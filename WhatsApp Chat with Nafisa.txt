04/09/20, 3:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Ha ha, okay.
04/09/20, 3:04 pm - Nafisa: Sohini ka aawaj sunke mood kharab ho jaata hain mera

04/09/20, 3:05 pm - Nafisa: No
04/09/20, 3:05 pm - Nafisa: She studies too much
04/09/20, 3:06 pm - Raktim Dey: That's true.
04/09/20, 3:06 pm - Nafisa: She is selfish also
04/09/20, 3:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Ajkal help bhi karti hai mera.
04/09/20, 3:07 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
04/09/20, 3:07 pm - Nafisa: Okay.
04/09/20, 3:17 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂😂
04/09/20, 8:03 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
04/09/20, 8:03 pm - Nafisa: No wait
04/09/20, 8:04 pm - Nafisa: Not this
04/09/20, 8:04 pm - Raktim Dey: What do you think?
04/09/20, 8:04 pm - Nafisa: You know what i hate this question
04/09/20, 8:05 pm - Raktim Dey: If A is isomorphic to B and B is isomorphic to C, does that mean A is isomorphic to C?
04/09/20, 8:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
04/09/20, 8:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Why?
04/09/20, 8:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Because isomorphism is a bijective map, so it's an equivalence relation. So this is true because of transitivity.
04/09/20, 8:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Did you understand?
04/09/20, 8:06 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
04/09/20, 8:06 pm - Nafisa: This was the example
04/09/20, 8:07 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha. Same here.
04/09/20, 8:07 pm - Nafisa: Here all are not isomorphic to G
04/09/20, 8:07 pm - Raktim Dey: Why?
04/09/20, 8:07 pm - Nafisa: But see
04/09/20, 8:07 pm - Nafisa: Z2 x Z2 is not isomorphic to Z4
04/09/20, 8:07 pm - Raktim Dey: I know.
04/09/20, 8:08 pm - Nafisa: Here
04/09/20, 8:08 pm - Nafisa: So how are all of them isomorphic to each other?
04/09/20, 8:08 pm - Raktim Dey: But this not needed here. They are individually isomorphic to Z360. So they are isomorphic to each other.
04/09/20, 8:09 pm - Raktim Dey: You can't break Z2×Z2 from there separately.
04/09/20, 8:09 pm - Nafisa: I'm not convinced
04/09/20, 8:09 pm - Nafisa: Can i call?
04/09/20, 8:09 pm - Raktim Dey: Ek second. Wait.
04/09/20, 8:09 pm - Raktim Dey: Let me understand the question.

04/09/20, 8:10 pm - Nafisa: This is Gallian
04/09/20, 8:10 pm - Raktim Dey: Page no?
04/09/20, 8:10 pm - Nafisa: 104 se chapter starts
04/09/20, 8:11 pm - Nafisa: 109
04/09/20, 8:11 pm - Raktim Dey: Wait.
04/09/20, 8:11 pm - Nafisa: You got my question?
04/09/20, 8:12 pm - Nafisa: No not 109
04/09/20, 8:12 pm - Nafisa: Its 214
04/09/20, 8:42 pm - Nafisa: Final year logo ka exam hone wala hain
04/09/20, 8:42 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>

04/09/20, 8:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Sem 4.
04/09/20, 8:45 pm - Nafisa: Chup karo yaar
04/09/20, 8:46 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay. But it's possible.
04/09/20, 8:46 pm - Nafisa: Jaa padhai kar ziada mat soch
04/09/20, 8:46 pm - Nafisa: Wtf
04/09/20, 8:46 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.😂
04/09/20, 8:46 pm - Nafisa: Now switching is gonna be so difficult
04/09/20, 8:47 pm - Nafisa: Mera net is so slow upar se
04/09/20, 8:47 pm - Raktim Dey: And wo bhi 2 week baad exam. Seniors ka.
04/09/20, 8:47 pm - Raktim Dey: It's awful.
04/09/20, 8:47 pm - Nafisa: Go study
04/09/20, 8:47 pm - Nafisa: Wahi toh
04/09/20, 8:47 pm - Nafisa: Most probably info were given to them
04/09/20, 8:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
04/09/20, 8:47 pm - Nafisa: Srijan bhaiya already joined MSC?
04/09/20, 8:47 pm - Raktim Dey: They haven't had any contact with college since July.
04/09/20, 8:48 pm - Nafisa: Lol

04/09/20, 9:04 pm - Nafisa: Repeat what was up to isomorphism?
04/09/20, 9:04 pm - Nafisa: Please
04/09/20, 9:04 pm - Nafisa: And stop giving me stress yaar
04/09/20, 9:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Means they aren't isomorphic to each other.
04/09/20, 9:04 pm - Raktim Dey: I think.
04/09/20, 9:04 pm - Nafisa: Don't ask about sem 4 now
04/09/20, 9:05 pm - Raktim Dey: It means they are isomorphic. Sorry.
04/09/20, 9:05 pm - Nafisa: I read just now if they are isomorphic to each other they are equivalent?
04/09/20, 9:05 pm - Nafisa: Ok
04/09/20, 9:05 pm - Nafisa: Thank you
04/09/20, 9:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
04/09/20, 9:06 pm - Nafisa: Sorry for this but i really can't
04/09/20, 9:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Then all those 1176 groups were isomorphic.
04/09/20, 9:06 pm - Raktim Dey: It's okay. I understand.
04/09/20, 9:06 pm - Nafisa: How?
04/09/20, 9:07 pm - Raktim Dey: They were up to isomorphism likha tha toh.
04/09/20, 9:07 pm - Nafisa: They all are isomorphic to some G of order 1176
04/09/20, 9:07 pm - Nafisa: Chor
04/09/20, 9:07 pm - Nafisa: I'm seriously very confused
04/09/20, 9:07 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
04/09/20, 9:08 pm - Nafisa: Ok
04/09/20, 9:09 pm - Raktim Dey: Initially I thought that they were isomorphic too. But the up to isomorphism thing confused me. Sorry about that.
04/09/20, 9:10 pm - Nafisa: Arey bro
04/09/20, 9:10 pm - Nafisa: Chill

04/09/20, 9:43 pm - Nafisa: It was all my fault
04/09/20, 9:43 pm - Raktim Dey: By Structure theorem.
04/09/20, 9:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Exactly.
04/09/20, 9:43 pm - Nafisa: I got the wrong idea and confused you
04/09/20, 9:43 pm - Nafisa: Finally!
04/09/20, 9:43 pm - Raktim Dey: It's okay. No problem.
04/09/20, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: Ye alag hain kya?
04/09/20, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: Or its part of Fundamental theorem?
04/09/20, 9:44 pm - Raktim Dey: They are the same thing.
04/09/20, 9:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Like abelian and commutative. Same meaning.
04/09/20, 9:48 pm - Nafisa: 🤦‍♀
04/09/20, 9:48 pm - Nafisa: Mera kya hoga
04/09/20, 9:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Don't worry. Hote hai sabse.😂

04/09/20, 9:50 pm - Raktim Dey: It was a little confusing.
04/09/20, 9:50 pm - Nafisa: I always regret taking Maths now
04/09/20, 9:51 pm - Nafisa: You need really good brains for it
04/09/20, 9:51 pm - Nafisa: Not like mine
04/09/20, 9:51 pm - Raktim Dey: It's not like that. It's a little too difficult in Xavier's.
04/09/20, 9:52 pm - Nafisa: ::(
04/09/20, 11:46 pm - Nafisa: Which edition you have of Gallian?

05/09/20, 11:18 am - Raktim Dey: He is really funny.
05/09/20, 11:21 am - Raktim Dey: Sigma is just a map from X to X. We needed to define a map from Aut(X) to Sn, ie, from all the bijections of the set Aut(X) to that of the set {1,2,3,....,n}. So we started from the index set of X, used f^-1 to go to X, then used sigma to to go X, then f to go to this image X's index set.
05/09/20, 11:40 am - Nafisa: OOOOMMMMGGG!!
05/09/20, 11:40 am - Nafisa: He is so amazing yaar! He called himself moron

05/09/20, 11:41 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah.😂😂
05/09/20, 11:41 am - Raktim Dey: He was making fun of himself.
05/09/20, 11:41 am - Raktim Dey: If you understand, it's easy.

05/09/20, 9:29 pm - Nafisa: Random Hi
05/09/20, 9:29 pm - Raktim Dey: Well done.
05/09/20, 9:30 pm - Nafisa: This is what i do to random guys
05/09/20, 9:30 pm - Raktim Dey: If only someone sent me random hi's too. 😂😂
05/09/20, 9:30 pm - Raktim Dey: I'd do things like this too.😂
05/09/20, 9:30 pm - Nafisa: Some have good guts to carry on convo and they become friends
05/09/20, 9:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Like Biswajit.
05/09/20, 9:30 pm - Raktim Dey: ?
05/09/20, 9:31 pm - Nafisa: Awee!! You went on many dates!🙂
05/09/20, 9:31 pm - Nafisa: Yeap

05/09/20, 9:31 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
05/09/20, 9:31 pm - Raktim Dey: Nice.
05/09/20, 9:32 pm - Nafisa: But Random Hi is soooo lame
05/09/20, 9:32 pm - Nafisa: It drops my interest on them to minus
05/09/20, 9:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Well obviously. Bina jaan pehchaan ka koi text kare toh it's weird.
05/09/20, 9:32 pm - Nafisa: Its stupid.
05/09/20, 9:33 pm - Nafisa: I know you are taking your chance but boi! Be smart!
05/09/20, 9:33 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
05/09/20, 9:34 pm - Raktim Dey: It's not even chance. They send hi's to 20 girls at a time.
05/09/20, 9:34 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
05/09/20, 9:34 pm - Nafisa: 20 girls!! Lol!
05/09/20, 9:35 pm - Nafisa: Its like uncountable sets
05/09/20, 9:35 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, probably.😂😂
05/09/20, 9:35 pm - Nafisa: Infinitely many
05/09/20, 9:35 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.😂😂
05/09/20, 9:35 pm - Raktim Dey: Math jokes.
05/09/20, 9:35 pm - Nafisa: Yo!
05/09/20, 9:35 pm - Nafisa: AD sir will be proud of us!
05/09/20, 9:36 pm - Raktim Dey: Next time, if someone sends a random hi, say that " our chances of having a proper conversation is less than epsilon". If the guy understands it, then talk with him.
05/09/20, 9:36 pm - Raktim Dey: I should hope so.😂
05/09/20, 10:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Give me your mail id.
05/09/20, 10:06 pm - Nafisa: If he gets it i will want him
05/09/20, 10:07 pm - Nafisa: nafisabarlaskar123@gmail.com
05/09/20, 10:07 pm - Raktim Dey: I know.😂😂

05/09/20, 10:08 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂😂😂
05/09/20, 10:08 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣i was about to not give too but then we have an interesting convo going on
05/09/20, 10:09 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, that's true.😂😂
05/09/20, 10:09 pm - Raktim Dey: You might find some math student from some other college.
05/09/20, 10:10 pm - Nafisa: It will be difficult for me to fall in love with a math lover
05/09/20, 10:10 pm - Raktim Dey: Why so?
05/09/20, 10:11 pm - Nafisa: Becoz i know it , when we love Math everything becomes secondary
05/09/20, 10:11 pm - Nafisa: As small as delta
05/09/20, 10:11 pm - Raktim Dey: That's not necessarily true.
05/09/20, 10:11 pm - Nafisa: And i wanna be greater than epsilon
05/09/20, 10:11 pm - Nafisa: I hope so
05/09/20, 10:11 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm sure you so. You don't want to have a limit.
05/09/20, 10:11 pm - Raktim Dey: You do*
05/09/20, 10:12 pm - Nafisa: Ofcourse
05/09/20, 10:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Got it.😂

05/09/20, 10:12 pm - Nafisa: No one can understand shit except for us
05/09/20, 10:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. That part is pretty cool.😂😂
05/09/20, 10:12 pm - Nafisa: So private
05/09/20, 10:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Exclusive.
05/09/20, 10:13 pm - Raktim Dey: Also, check your mail.
05/09/20, 10:13 pm - Nafisa: Its like you make fun of someone sitting right beside them and they laugh along without understanding
05/09/20, 10:13 pm - Nafisa: Yeah . Got it can't load now
05/09/20, 10:13 pm - Nafisa: Tomorrow
05/09/20, 10:14 pm - Raktim Dey: When you're the one making fun, then that's acceptable.😂😂
05/09/20, 10:14 pm - Raktim Dey: It's like saying, you're being e(irrational).
05/09/20, 10:14 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂
05/09/20, 10:14 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
05/09/20, 10:35 pm - Raktim Dey: Please check out the video Mihir shared.

12/09/20, 10:50 am - Nafisa: Sorry
12/09/20, 10:50 am - Raktim Dey: You don't have to say sorry. It's okay.
12/09/20, 10:50 am - Raktim Dey: Are you okay?
12/09/20, 10:51 am - Nafisa: I'm okay
12/09/20, 10:51 am - Raktim Dey: I still haven't talked to Ben. I don't even know what I should say.

12/09/20, 2:53 pm - Raktim Dey: Inform*
12/09/20, 2:53 pm - Nafisa: They will give barely two weeks
12/09/20, 2:54 pm - Nafisa: Great

12/09/20, 2:54 pm - Nafisa: Why is life doing this to me
12/09/20, 2:54 pm - Nafisa: Already i have sleepless nights
12/09/20, 2:54 pm - Raktim Dey: Why?
12/09/20, 2:54 pm - Nafisa: Sigh.
12/09/20, 2:54 pm - Raktim Dey: Thinking about studies?
12/09/20, 2:55 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm more worried about Ben. How is he gonna cope with all these exams.
12/09/20, 2:55 pm - Nafisa: OMG!
12/09/20, 2:55 pm - Nafisa: He has no clue this is coming up
12/09/20, 2:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Exactly.
12/09/20, 2:55 pm - Nafisa: Can't even tell him
12/09/20, 2:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
12/09/20, 2:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Don't tell him now.
12/09/20, 2:56 pm - Nafisa: Never
12/09/20, 2:56 pm - Raktim Dey: He already has a lot of problems.
12/09/20, 2:56 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
12/09/20, 3:27 pm - Nafisa: I'm filling it now?
12/09/20, 3:28 pm - Raktim Dey: What?
12/09/20, 3:28 pm - Raktim Dey: That form?
12/09/20, 3:28 pm - Nafisa: Hmm
12/09/20, 3:28 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
12/09/20, 3:28 pm - Nafisa: Ok
12/09/20, 3:30 pm - Nafisa: I feel liking doing all no
12/09/20, 3:30 pm - Raktim Dey: See, you're giving your name alongwith the form. So be careful what you say yes and no to.
12/09/20, 3:30 pm - Nafisa: But when SR asked no one told they don't have
12/09/20, 3:30 pm - Nafisa: Yes
12/09/20, 3:31 pm - Raktim Dey: Exactly.
12/09/20, 3:31 pm - Nafisa: Ok got it
12/09/20, 3:32 pm - Raktim Dey: See, it doesn't matter anyway. For the majority of people, they're rich and so they'll say they have computers and they use it. And the college will go with the majority. They won't care about the few people who don't have computers. The worst part is, the survey didn't have any questions about network and internet. So, it's just a formality for college. I know it sounds harsh, but it's the truth.
12/09/20, 3:33 pm - Nafisa: I know
12/09/20, 3:33 pm - Nafisa: I was thinking that only
12/09/20, 3:33 pm - Nafisa: No option for net

12/09/20, 3:36 pm - Nafisa: My brain has stop working
12/09/20, 3:36 pm - Raktim Dey: I didn't attend DS' first class.
12/09/20, 3:36 pm - Nafisa: All i could think about was Ben
12/09/20, 3:36 pm - Raktim Dey: I just kept thinking about Ben.
12/09/20, 3:36 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
12/09/20, 3:37 pm - Nafisa: I wanna call him and let him talk
12/09/20, 3:37 pm - Nafisa: But he doesn't
12/09/20, 3:37 pm - Raktim Dey: Give him some time.
12/09/20, 3:37 pm - Nafisa: Yeah
12/09/20, 3:37 pm - Nafisa: Now i will just wait
12/09/20, 3:37 pm - Nafisa: This affected me so bad
12/09/20, 3:38 pm - Nafisa: Never thought this was coming
12/09/20, 3:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. He is very close to you I know.
12/09/20, 3:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Ben.
12/09/20, 3:38 pm - Nafisa: Now this exam thing
12/09/20, 3:38 pm - Nafisa: Along with that i have my own family problems
12/09/20, 3:38 pm - Nafisa: My mind is gonna burst
12/09/20, 3:39 pm - Nafisa: I wanna go to eternal sleep
12/09/20, 3:40 pm - Raktim Dey: No no, don't say that. I know it's a terrible and awful situation but we all have to go through this together. Just a few more months and then it'll be over.
12/09/20, 3:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Even if you get an arrear or unable to sit for exams, in the worst case scenario, that's not the end of the world. Your parents and everyone else will understand.
12/09/20, 3:41 pm - Nafisa: No
12/09/20, 3:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Even if it's the same case for me, I know my mother will understand.
12/09/20, 3:41 pm - Nafisa: They won't
12/09/20, 3:41 pm - Raktim Dey: They have to.
12/09/20, 3:41 pm - Raktim Dey: They're parents.
12/09/20, 3:41 pm - Nafisa: You are lucky your Mom will
12/09/20, 3:42 pm - Nafisa: I hate everything around now
12/09/20, 3:42 pm - Nafisa: Every single thing
12/09/20, 3:42 pm - Nafisa: I never saw life was taking me here
12/09/20, 3:43 pm - Nafisa: O GOD!!
12/09/20, 3:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I didn't imagine either that it'll be like this. But the thing is, we don't really have another option right now. We're gonna have to do what college says.
12/09/20, 3:43 pm - Nafisa: Yes

12/09/20, 6:33 pm - Raktim Dey: I didn't know what to say. I haven't talked to him since then.
12/09/20, 6:33 pm - Nafisa: He notices small things you know. Thats why
12/09/20, 6:33 pm - Nafisa: Its okay. I understand

14/09/20, 11:09 am - Raktim Dey: You're calculating Hi. That is H2.
14/09/20, 11:10 am - Nafisa: Yes
14/09/20, 11:10 am - Nafisa: So
14/09/20, 11:10 am - Raktim Dey: But you don't have to find this out by formula. Just write H2=1/2.
14/09/20, 11:11 am - Nafisa: I know but why is it not coming out...it should na
14/09/20, 11:11 am - Nafisa: I thought you understood
14/09/20, 11:12 am - Raktim Dey: I tried to but I couldn't. Minerva told me we don't need to find out for every interval. The value for integration on [x0,X1] will be the same as [X1,X2].
14/09/20, 11:12 am - Nafisa: Ok
14/09/20, 11:12 am - Nafisa: Why do you sleep so late?
14/09/20, 11:13 am - Raktim Dey: Kal thora der ho gaya tha.
14/09/20, 11:13 am - Raktim Dey: Usually itna der ko nahi sota hu.
14/09/20, 11:13 am - Nafisa: Haan
14/09/20, 11:14 am - Nafisa: Aaj raat ko wo sum samjhana
14/09/20, 11:14 am - Nafisa: DS ka
14/09/20, 11:14 am - Nafisa: I will ask
14/09/20, 11:14 am - Raktim Dey: Assignment wala?
14/09/20, 11:14 am - Nafisa: Yeap
14/09/20, 11:14 am - Raktim Dey: Okay.
14/09/20, 11:15 am - Nafisa: Good memory
14/09/20, 11:15 am - Raktim Dey: Mera wala incomplete tha by the way.
14/09/20, 11:15 am - Nafisa: You know na how to solve?
14/09/20, 11:15 am - Raktim Dey: Yes. That I'll tell you then.
14/09/20, 11:15 am - Nafisa: Okk
14/09/20, 6:49 pm - Nafisa: Smooth simple curves went above my brain!!
14/09/20, 6:49 pm - Nafisa: Is it even there?
14/09/20, 6:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Just read the definition. That's enough.
14/09/20, 7:19 pm - Nafisa: Ok now one question
14/09/20, 7:20 pm - Nafisa: If dx/dt decreases and dy/dt increases dy/dx ??
14/09/20, 7:21 pm - Nafisa: And if either way if dx/dt increases and dy/dt decreases then dy/dx??
14/09/20, 7:21 pm - Raktim Dey: dy/dx decreases in both cases.
14/09/20, 7:23 pm - Nafisa: Nope
14/09/20, 7:26 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
14/09/20, 7:26 pm - Nafisa: If i'm not wrong
14/09/20, 7:36 pm - Raktim Dey: What increases?
14/09/20, 7:37 pm - Raktim Dey: And anyway, dy/dx represents the tangent line at each point.
14/09/20, 7:37 pm - Nafisa: Haan
14/09/20, 7:37 pm - Nafisa: So it increases
14/09/20, 7:39 pm - Nafisa: I'm saying we don't see the signs na its actually the tangent
14/09/20, 7:40 pm - Raktim Dey: dy/dx =dy/dt / dx/dt. If one of them increases and the other one decreases, then dy/dx will decrease.
14/09/20, 7:41 pm - Nafisa: Then whats wrong here?
14/09/20, 7:41 pm - Nafisa: Why is it increasing here?
14/09/20, 7:41 pm - Nafisa: If dx/dt decreases and dy/dt decreases then dy/dx increases??
14/09/20, 8:27 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
14/09/20, 8:28 pm - Raktim Dey: Nah. I forgot. I'll call him tomorrow. He doesn't pick up call these days though.

17/09/20, 7:03 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
17/09/20, 7:05 pm - Nafisa: Why H?
17/09/20, 7:05 pm - Nafisa: Why not G:Gx
17/09/20, 7:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Because we are performing the group action on H.
17/09/20, 7:05 pm - Nafisa: Becoz partition usme ho raha hain?

18/09/20, 9:25 am - Raktim Dey: No no. N(H)=g∈G:gHg-¹=H.
18/09/20, 9:38 am - Nafisa: Matlab the group gh=hg is the subgroup showing gH can be a subgroup?
18/09/20, 9:54 am - Raktim Dey: gH was just an example. He was gH may not be s subgroup but gHg-¹ us always a subgroup.
18/09/20, 9:58 am - Nafisa: What was the question ? gHg-1 is always a subgroup of G when H is a subgroup?
18/09/20, 9:58 am - Raktim Dey: Yes.
18/09/20, 9:59 am - Nafisa: Damn!
18/09/20, 9:59 am - Nafisa: Ok

18/09/20, 12:30 pm - Raktim Dey: He was asking if you're from Assam.
18/09/20, 12:30 pm - Raktim Dey: I said you live in Mizoram.
18/09/20, 12:30 pm - Nafisa: Yes
18/09/20, 12:30 pm - Nafisa: He always thinks i'm from Assam

19/09/20, 9:34 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah. Okay.
19/09/20, 9:36 am - Raktim Dey: [G:H] is the index of H in G, meaning the no of left cosets of H in G. And L ={xH:x€G}. So the number of elements of L is the no of distinct left cosets of H in G. So [G:H]=|L|.
19/09/20, 9:42 am - Nafisa: Ok
19/09/20, 10:44 am - Nafisa: Sej ka bday kab hain?

20/09/20, 11:41 am - Nafisa: Sir way is so casual
20/09/20, 11:41 am - Nafisa: For correspondence theorem you need map na
20/09/20, 11:42 am - Nafisa: Canonical homomorphism is an onto homomorphism when N is normal in G
20/09/20, 11:43 am - Nafisa: Theek hain define an onto homomorphism and apply the correspondence theoren

20/09/20, 11:47 am - Raktim Dey: Correspondence theorem is not a big thing. We did it in quotient groups in sem 3. We just didn't know that the theorem had a name.
20/09/20, 11:48 am - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
20/09/20, 11:51 am - Nafisa: I know correspondence theorem

20/09/20, 12:08 pm - Nafisa: Asshole
20/09/20, 12:08 pm - Nafisa: I asked Mayura to ask him
20/09/20, 12:08 pm - Nafisa: I spend way too much time in RI now i regret
20/09/20, 12:09 pm - Nafisa: Its okay

22/09/20, 10:35 am - Nafisa: P and Q were sylow p subgroups of N(H) all becoz once we proved [G:H]=[N(H):H](mod p) where here H is Q
22/09/20, 10:35 am - Nafisa: ??
22/09/20, 10:41 am - Raktim Dey: No no, that's the order toh. Not the subgroup.
22/09/20, 10:41 am - Raktim Dey: Q belongs to N(Q) trivially.
22/09/20, 10:42 am - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
22/09/20, 10:42 am - Nafisa: Not that
22/09/20, 10:42 am - Nafisa: Whats the order of N(Q)

22/09/20, 10:52 am - Nafisa: Ok
22/09/20, 11:24 am - Nafisa: Ok
22/09/20, 4:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Did you understand the N(Q) proof?

29/09/20, 11:16 pm - Raktim Dey: Even my program has that int n outside. It's not a big deal. Just fun.
29/09/20, 11:16 pm - Raktim Dey: I know. That's why I didn't tell her.

01/10/20, 10:25 am - Raktim Dey: When you define x=t, y=t²,-1≤t≤2, you see that at t =-1,x=-1 and at t=2,x=2. But we need the curve to go from (2,4) to (-1,1), the opposite direction. So we are reversing the parametrization.
01/10/20, 10:33 am - Nafisa: Okay

04/10/20, 10:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Pehle topic decide karo. Then you'll get one.
04/10/20, 10:25 pm - Raktim Dey: That's a bit of a problem.
04/10/20, 10:25 pm - Nafisa: Wahi toh nahi ho raha
04/10/20, 10:25 pm - Nafisa: Very big problem
04/10/20, 10:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Give preference according to which teacher you like.
04/10/20, 10:25 pm - Nafisa: SR was supposed to explain today she didn't

04/10/20, 10:27 pm - Nafisa: Don't make me feel worse now
04/10/20, 10:27 pm - Raktim Dey: You could get TB.
04/10/20, 10:27 pm - Raktim Dey: You like TB toh.
04/10/20, 10:27 pm - Nafisa: I have no clue about fuzzy sets
04/10/20, 10:27 pm - Nafisa: And acc to seniors DS is better
04/10/20, 10:27 pm - Raktim Dey: You'll learn. I don't know what it is either.
04/10/20, 10:27 pm - Nafisa: He helps and TB doesn't
04/10/20, 10:28 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know. Pritha Di told me.
04/10/20, 10:28 pm - Nafisa: So many of them told
04/10/20, 10:28 pm - Nafisa: So don't wanna take risk
04/10/20, 10:28 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
04/10/20, 10:28 pm - Nafisa: AD i like but AD confuses in class
04/10/20, 10:28 pm - Nafisa: And project main kiya toh i'm dead
04/10/20, 10:28 pm - Raktim Dey: AD is too risky.
04/10/20, 10:29 pm - Raktim Dey: His topics seem difficult.
04/10/20, 10:29 pm - Nafisa: Wahi
04/10/20, 10:29 pm - Raktim Dey: PD hai toh.
04/10/20, 10:29 pm - Nafisa: What?
04/10/20, 10:29 pm - Nafisa: That man sucks
04/10/20, 10:29 pm - Nafisa: And analysis is difficult for me
04/10/20, 10:29 pm - Raktim Dey: It's a 5 student class. Every teacher will be extra careful.
04/10/20, 10:29 pm - Raktim Dey: Take something else.
04/10/20, 10:29 pm - Nafisa: I hate GT and PD
04/10/20, 10:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Me too.
04/10/20, 10:30 pm - Nafisa: PD ke topics is analysis and metric space toh
04/10/20, 10:30 pm - Nafisa: PD mereko kabhi nahi padha payega
04/10/20, 10:31 pm - Raktim Dey: Then your best option is TB. SR ko 1, TB and DS ko 2 3 rakh do.
04/10/20, 10:31 pm - Raktim Dey: Rest kuch bhi daal do.
04/10/20, 10:32 pm - Nafisa: SR chahiye mereko
04/10/20, 10:32 pm - Raktim Dey: SR ko 1 do.
04/10/20, 10:32 pm - Nafisa: You know but DS ke topics are attracting me
04/10/20, 10:32 pm - Nafisa: Arms race
04/10/20, 10:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Love prediction?
04/10/20, 10:33 pm - Nafisa: Wo kya hain nahi pata
04/10/20, 10:33 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂😂
04/10/20, 10:33 pm - Nafisa: Arms race is about transportation of weapons for war
04/10/20, 10:33 pm - Nafisa: Nice na
04/10/20, 10:33 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know. Differential equations.
04/10/20, 10:33 pm - Nafisa: SR ka is mostly probability
04/10/20, 10:33 pm - Nafisa: I like it
04/10/20, 10:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes. And differential equations.
04/10/20, 10:34 pm - Nafisa: Even that differential equation is related to probabilty
04/10/20, 10:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
04/10/20, 10:34 pm - Nafisa: So i'm not confident with probability
04/10/20, 10:34 pm - Nafisa: I struggle alot with it
04/10/20, 10:35 pm - Nafisa: Sem 4 main dega na tumne ...
04/10/20, 10:35 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
04/10/20, 10:35 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm interested in DS ke topics too.
04/10/20, 10:35 pm - Raktim Dey: Chaos theory.
04/10/20, 10:36 pm - Nafisa: Tell me about it?
04/10/20, 10:38 pm - Nafisa: Bolona?
04/10/20, 10:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Wait.
04/10/20, 10:39 pm - Raktim Dey: My mother called
04/10/20, 10:39 pm - Raktim Dey: .

04/10/20, 10:39 pm - Nafisa: Where are you
04/10/20, 10:39 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm at home.
04/10/20, 10:39 pm - Nafisa: Ahhh
04/10/20, 10:39 pm - Nafisa: Ok
04/10/20, 10:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Chaos theory is a part of applied mathematics, differential equations, mechanics.
04/10/20, 10:40 pm - Nafisa: 😒
04/10/20, 10:40 pm - Nafisa: Waah sab samaj aa gaya
04/10/20, 10:40 pm - Nafisa: Mechanics 🙂
04/10/20, 10:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Search butterfly effect on Google.
04/10/20, 10:41 pm - Nafisa: I saw
04/10/20, 10:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
04/10/20, 10:41 pm - Nafisa: The picture was nice

04/10/20, 10:41 pm - Nafisa: Is it hard?
04/10/20, 10:41 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't know, but it's interesting.
04/10/20, 10:41 pm - Nafisa: Saala jis paper main arrear aaya i like that...look at the irony
04/10/20, 10:42 pm - Raktim Dey: It happens sometimes. Maybe your mechanics part is bad, and differential is good.
04/10/20, 10:43 pm - Nafisa: Chaos theory is a bad idea then?
04/10/20, 10:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Depends on how your concept of mechanics and differential is.
04/10/20, 10:44 pm - Nafisa: Mechanics samaj aa bhi jaaye sums nahi hota
04/10/20, 10:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Then don't take it
04/10/20, 10:44 pm - Raktim Dey: .
04/10/20, 10:44 pm - Nafisa: Differential is technical
04/10/20, 10:45 pm - Nafisa: So if i get it i can do it
04/10/20, 10:46 pm - Nafisa: Oye?
04/10/20, 10:46 pm - Nafisa: Come back
04/10/20, 10:46 pm - Raktim Dey: It depends. But don't take chaos theory. Take something else.
04/10/20, 10:46 pm - Nafisa: I'm not getting sleep since few days help me
04/10/20, 10:46 pm - Nafisa: Hmm
04/10/20, 10:47 pm - Nafisa: You know about astronomy?
04/10/20, 10:47 pm - Nafisa: Paulie said its about finding the position of stars or something
04/10/20, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: TB DS and SR ko 1 2 3 de do. DS mil gaya, toh arms race le lena, or something that you like.
04/10/20, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
04/10/20, 10:51 pm - Nafisa: SR hui toh , kismat khul jayega

15/10/20, 12:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. But the syllabus will be till 12th March whatever they taught.
15/10/20, 8:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Is it a ring with unity? Is it a domain? Is it an ED, PID or UFD? Can you factorise polynomials in it's polynomial ring?
15/10/20, 8:48 pm - Nafisa: Tor kopal
15/10/20, 8:49 pm - Nafisa: The polynimial will be you and you factorise with your partner after family planning
15/10/20, 8:49 pm - Nafisa: The term family planning will be introduced later in the syllabus
15/10/20, 8:50 pm - Raktim Dey: I hope not.

15/10/20, 9:51 pm - Nafisa: For us but not all
15/10/20, 9:51 pm - Nafisa: Becoz i want🤷‍♀
15/10/20, 9:57 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.😂
16/10/20, 11:10 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
16/10/20, 11:10 am - Nafisa: Later you tell
16/10/20, 11:10 am - Raktim Dey: Okay.
16/10/20, 11:23 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
16/10/20, 11:23 am - Nafisa: Later
16/10/20, 11:23 am - Raktim Dey: We are assuming it.
16/10/20, 11:33 am - Nafisa: We ensure the existence of the root within the interval before taking x0?
16/10/20, 11:34 am - Raktim Dey: He's saying we can take x0 from even outside the interval.
16/10/20, 11:35 am - Nafisa: What about the existence of the root
16/10/20, 11:35 am - Raktim Dey: He didn't say about that, did he?
16/10/20, 11:35 am - Nafisa: Ask
16/10/20, 11:36 am - Raktim Dey: But why wouldn't root exist? Root of an equation always exists.
16/10/20, 11:36 am - Nafisa: We know the function
16/10/20, 11:36 am - Nafisa: ?
16/10/20, 11:37 am - Raktim Dey: No. But root will exist toh.
16/10/20, 11:37 am - Raktim Dey: It will exist in [a,b] if f(a)f(b)<0.
16/10/20, 11:47 am - Nafisa: So newton raphson method apply karne se phele we ensure the existence of the root by some other method?
16/10/20, 11:49 am - Raktim Dey: Root will exist. But whether your sequence will converge, that's the thing.
16/10/20, 11:49 am - Nafisa: How do you know root will exist at all
16/10/20, 11:49 am - Raktim Dey: It's a polynomial toh.
16/10/20, 12:03 pm - Nafisa: Ok
16/10/20, 12:03 pm - Nafisa: So
16/10/20, 12:03 pm - Nafisa: No
16/10/20, 12:03 pm - Nafisa: We don't know root exist or not
16/10/20, 12:04 pm - Nafisa: Later
16/10/20, 12:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
16/10/20, 6:56 pm - Nafisa: I have send you a mail

17/10/20, 6:56 am - Nafisa: With the interval [0,1] im trapezoidal i got 2.something and simpson i got 5.something
17/10/20, 6:56 am - Nafisa: Which is not possible
17/10/20, 9:57 am - Raktim Dey: In Simpson, you wrote the loop wrong.

17/10/20, 8:51 pm - Nafisa: Mera galti kya tha
17/10/20, 8:52 pm - Nafisa: Loop main?
17/10/20, 8:52 pm - Nafisa: Amd i don't understand bisection aur tabulation ka programs
17/10/20, 8:52 pm - Nafisa: 😭😭
17/10/20, 8:53 pm - Raktim Dey: Loop me if i%2 is zero, then sum =sum +2*y.
17/10/20, 8:56 pm - Nafisa: Nahi samajhi
17/10/20, 8:56 pm - Nafisa: Samjhi
17/10/20, 8:57 pm - Nafisa: But for loop ke saat bhi kar sakte hain

17/10/20, 8:58 pm - Nafisa: Why sending this
17/10/20, 8:58 pm - Nafisa: See my n is different becoz i didn't use if else
17/10/20, 8:59 pm - Nafisa: Choro
17/10/20, 8:59 pm - Nafisa: I will use the other one
17/10/20, 8:59 pm - Raktim Dey: But you have to use if else
17/10/20, 9:00 pm - Raktim Dey: .
17/10/20, 9:04 pm - Nafisa: Ok
17/10/20, 9:06 pm - Nafisa: Tabulation ka algorithm kiya hain?

18/10/20, 11:43 am - Raktim Dey: Bolo.
18/10/20, 11:47 am - Nafisa: When i put k ka value 4 instead of 1 for k<=4 ,the last three steps got cut
18/10/20, 11:47 am - Raktim Dey: Obviously.
18/10/20, 11:48 am - Nafisa: What does it mean?
18/10/20, 11:48 am - Raktim Dey: It means you're only finding the first interval where the root lies and stopping there.
18/10/20, 11:50 am - Nafisa: For k<=6 it will be first three interval when k=4
18/10/20, 11:50 am - Raktim Dey: Matlab?
18/10/20, 11:50 am - Nafisa: Wait
18/10/20, 11:52 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>

18/10/20, 11:53 am - Raktim Dey: Why will you start from 4?
18/10/20, 11:53 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
18/10/20, 11:53 am - Raktim Dey: If you start from 4 and end at 6, the loop will run three times only.
18/10/20, 11:54 am - Nafisa: wahi pooch rahi thi
18/10/20, 11:54 am - Raktim Dey: Achha.
18/10/20, 11:54 am - Nafisa: Just trying to get this k thing
18/10/20, 11:54 am - Raktim Dey: Okay.
18/10/20, 11:54 am - Raktim Dey: Now you got it?
18/10/20, 11:54 am - Nafisa: Yes
18/10/20, 11:54 am - Raktim Dey: Okay.

04/11/20, 1:56 pm - Raktim Dey: You can.
04/11/20, 1:57 pm - Nafisa: So my parametrisation becomes x=1+t and y=3+t, hobe na?
04/11/20, 1:58 pm - Raktim Dey: x=1+2t, y=2+2t.
04/11/20, 1:58 pm - Nafisa: Nono

04/11/20, 7:04 pm - Nafisa: You have the book
04/11/20, 7:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
04/11/20, 7:04 pm - Nafisa: I feel so bad , my eyes sometimes burns becoz of laptop and phone
04/11/20, 7:04 pm - Nafisa: I have them all
04/11/20, 7:06 pm - Nafisa: Bhai r parchina
04/11/20, 7:06 pm - Nafisa: R hobena
04/11/20, 7:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I can understand.
04/11/20, 7:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Staring at a screen all day is bad for health too.
04/11/20, 7:07 pm - Raktim Dey: You're studying now?
04/11/20, 7:13 pm - Nafisa: Since yesterday i'm staring at my notes and sleeping for about 10 hours
04/11/20, 7:13 pm - Nafisa: My brain has stopped working
04/11/20, 7:13 pm - Raktim Dey: Take a break then. Do something fun.
04/11/20, 7:13 pm - Nafisa: I don't have time
04/11/20, 7:14 pm - Nafisa: And nothing is fun
04/11/20, 7:14 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, true.
04/11/20, 7:16 pm - Raktim Dey: You know, ever since they told us about sem 5 cia and sem 4 exams all so soon, at first I just couldn't feel anything. The pressure, the sadness, anything. It was all just a blur. I mean, for the last two days, I haven't been concentrating in class properly either.
04/11/20, 7:16 pm - Raktim Dey: I couldn't follow in RI's class today and I love his class.
04/11/20, 7:16 pm - Nafisa: I just stare at the screen
04/11/20, 7:16 pm - Nafisa: I was so happy i could solve sums during the break
04/11/20, 7:17 pm - Nafisa: Ever since they announced i get nothing
04/11/20, 7:17 pm - Nafisa: RI main i don't understand anything, i'm not enjoying anything
04/11/20, 7:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. It takes up too much time and some of the teachers don't teach well. I don't even like TB now.
04/11/20, 7:17 pm - Nafisa: I feel dead
04/11/20, 7:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
04/11/20, 7:18 pm - Nafisa: Apparently
04/11/20, 7:18 pm - Raktim Dey: It's too much.
04/11/20, 7:18 pm - Nafisa: Bhai hobena
04/11/20, 7:19 pm - Nafisa: I find everything very hard
04/11/20, 7:19 pm - Raktim Dey: That's what she said.
04/11/20, 7:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Sorry.
04/11/20, 7:20 pm - Nafisa: Its okay
04/11/20, 7:20 pm - Raktim Dey: I thought you'd laugh.
04/11/20, 7:41 pm - Nafisa: Using scalar potential ,how do we calculate line integral?
04/11/20, 7:46 pm - Raktim Dey: F= grad phi, so find phi. This F is path independent, so the line integral will be phi(3,4)-phi(1,2).
04/11/20, 7:46 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm not absolutely sure, but I think it's this way.
04/11/20, 7:57 pm - Nafisa: I will make sir solve it
04/11/20, 7:57 pm - Raktim Dey: I think he will.
04/11/20, 7:57 pm - Nafisa: RI ka syllabus kya tha?
04/11/20, 7:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Number theory, extension fields.
04/11/20, 7:58 pm - Nafisa: Burnside was already there in previous cia na?
04/11/20, 8:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
04/11/20, 8:06 pm - Nafisa: Ok
04/11/20, 8:10 pm - Nafisa: See my status and tell me you would so something similar?
04/11/20, 8:12 pm - Raktim Dey: This looks like fish battered fry.
04/11/20, 8:12 pm - Nafisa: Idk
04/11/20, 8:12 pm - Nafisa: Not the point
04/11/20, 8:12 pm - Nafisa: The caption is where you need to pay heed
04/11/20, 8:12 pm - Raktim Dey: I saw the caption.
04/11/20, 8:13 pm - Nafisa: And?
04/11/20, 8:13 pm - Raktim Dey: I probably won't kill them. And I won't make a video of them either. I'd go play FIFA.
04/11/20, 8:13 pm - Nafisa: 🤦‍♀🤦‍♀
04/11/20, 8:13 pm - Nafisa: Useless
04/11/20, 8:13 pm - Raktim Dey: Always.
04/11/20, 8:13 pm - Nafisa: I would never make their video but
04/11/20, 8:14 pm - Nafisa: Do all that
04/11/20, 8:14 pm - Nafisa: Actually i have already done
04/11/20, 8:14 pm - Nafisa: Its very much fun
04/11/20, 8:14 pm - Raktim Dey: Killing them?
04/11/20, 8:14 pm - Nafisa: Not that part
04/11/20, 8:14 pm - Nafisa: But confusing them
04/11/20, 8:14 pm - Nafisa: Sometimes i did spare them you know
04/11/20, 8:15 pm - Nafisa: I'm nice
04/11/20, 8:15 pm - Raktim Dey: You are.😂
04/11/20, 8:15 pm - Raktim Dey: I'd rather kill humans than insects.
04/11/20, 8:20 pm - Nafisa: See just a big deal, i'm too lazy to do all that and get rid of their body and all
04/11/20, 8:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Maybe another time then, when you have free time.
04/11/20, 8:25 pm - Nafisa: Okay
04/11/20, 9:31 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
04/11/20, 10:19 pm - Nafisa: Still sir will do
04/11/20, 10:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
04/11/20, 10:24 pm - Raktim Dey: This is correct.
04/11/20, 10:27 pm - Nafisa: That i can see toh
04/11/20, 10:27 pm - Nafisa: Answer is matching
04/11/20, 10:27 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
04/11/20, 11:09 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
04/11/20, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
04/11/20, 11:34 pm - Nafisa: Then we can say every finite ID is a field and write this na?
04/11/20, 11:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
04/11/20, 11:35 pm - Nafisa: Hu
04/11/20, 11:35 pm - Nafisa: Finally after hours of talking and thinking i feel okay
04/11/20, 11:35 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha. That's good.
04/11/20, 11:35 pm - Nafisa: Ye
05/11/20, 11:18 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
05/11/20, 11:19 am - Raktim Dey: No.
05/11/20, 11:48 am - Nafisa: Why?
05/11/20, 11:49 am - Nafisa: Path independent hain bola
05/11/20, 11:49 am - Raktim Dey: The curve is moving from (1,2) to (3,4).
05/11/20, 11:49 am - Nafisa: Ok
05/11/20, 11:50 am - Nafisa: So orientation comes?
05/11/20, 11:50 am - Raktim Dey: Yes.
05/11/20, 11:51 am - Raktim Dey: Here your orientation is reversed.
05/11/20, 11:51 am - Nafisa: Then idhar path independence ka kuch nahi hain?
05/11/20, 11:51 am - Nafisa: Can i not reverse it?
05/11/20, 11:51 am - Nafisa: Choosing my own path
05/11/20, 11:52 am - Raktim Dey: If you reverse it, your parametrization will change. t will become -t.
05/11/20, 11:52 am - Nafisa: Ok
05/11/20, 12:39 pm - Nafisa: Can you understand what he teaches?
05/11/20, 12:40 pm - Raktim Dey: No. I was studying LPP for cia during the class.
05/11/20, 12:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Artificial variables.
05/11/20, 12:40 pm - Nafisa: Ok
05/11/20, 12:41 pm - Nafisa: From where do you solve?

05/11/20, 8:57 pm - Nafisa: Ideas bhi mat de ab
05/11/20, 8:57 pm - Raktim Dey: But I don't know graph theory.
05/11/20, 8:57 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂
05/11/20, 8:57 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣🤣
05/11/20, 8:57 pm - Nafisa: Its new

05/11/20, 9:00 pm - Nafisa: Exactly
05/11/20, 9:00 pm - Raktim Dey: DS, AD, TB.
05/11/20, 9:01 pm - Nafisa: Atleast GT didn't act
05/11/20, 9:01 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.😂
05/11/20, 9:01 pm - Nafisa: He was like that
05/11/20, 9:01 pm - Nafisa: AD and TB are hypocrites

05/11/20, 9:02 pm - Nafisa: Sem 4 he taught well
05/11/20, 9:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Not all. A few, last me.
05/11/20, 9:02 pm - Raktim Dey: He taught wrong there too.
05/11/20, 9:03 pm - Nafisa: Well well
05/11/20, 9:03 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
05/11/20, 9:03 pm - Nafisa: I went personally for doubts so
05/11/20, 9:03 pm - Nafisa: Yet i fucked up in CIA
05/11/20, 9:03 pm - Nafisa: That was my fault
05/11/20, 9:03 pm - Raktim Dey: Sem 4?

06/11/20, 11:59 am - Nafisa: Mereko bohot hard laga raha hain
06/11/20, 11:59 am - Raktim Dey: It is. Confusing bhi hai thora.
06/11/20, 11:59 am - Nafisa: Text book main hain kya?
06/11/20, 12:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
06/11/20, 12:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Which book do you need?
06/11/20, 12:01 pm - Raktim Dey: Do you want Sinha Pradhan?
06/11/20, 12:02 pm - Nafisa: I don't have sinha
06/11/20, 12:02 pm - Nafisa: Madhumangal dekha nahi ab tak
06/11/20, 12:03 pm - Raktim Dey: Which chapter do you need?
06/11/20, 12:03 pm - Raktim Dey: Of sinha pradhan?

06/11/20, 12:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
06/11/20, 12:04 pm - Nafisa: Becoz sir ka notes seems difficult
06/11/20, 12:04 pm - Raktim Dey: You can only understand when you solve problems.
06/11/20, 12:04 pm - Nafisa: Ok, sinha main ziada detail main hain kya?
06/11/20, 12:04 pm - Nafisa: O God!
06/11/20, 12:05 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm studying from that only. I haven't checked madhumangal pal.
06/11/20, 12:05 pm - Nafisa: Ok
06/11/20, 12:35 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
06/11/20, 12:35 pm - Nafisa: Becoz to find such alpha we need a polynomial only na
06/11/20, 12:36 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
06/11/20, 12:37 pm - Nafisa: Correct do
06/11/20, 12:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Wait.
06/11/20, 12:43 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
06/11/20, 12:47 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
06/11/20, 12:48 pm - Nafisa: Why do we need to always change the side?
06/11/20, 12:48 pm - Raktim Dey: To get rid of the cube root.
06/11/20, 12:49 pm - Nafisa: Eta holon
06/11/20, 12:49 pm - Nafisa: ?*
06/11/20, 12:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, it's correct.
06/11/20, 12:51 pm - Nafisa: How to show irreducibilty?
06/11/20, 1:03 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't know yet. It's degree is more than 3 and it's Eisenstein can't be used.
06/11/20, 1:03 pm - Nafisa: Eisentein can be used only for which degrees?
06/11/20, 1:04 pm - Nafisa: Kab kar paoge ,bhejna
06/11/20, 1:06 pm - Nafisa: Jab*
06/11/20, 1:06 pm - Raktim Dey: That doesn't depend on degree. But in there, all the coefficients must be divided by the same prime.
06/11/20, 1:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Except the xⁿ ka coefficient.
06/11/20, 1:07 pm - Nafisa: Wahi nahi ho raha
06/11/20, 1:08 pm - Raktim Dey: Ask RI in today's class. I want to know how to solve it too.
06/11/20, 1:08 pm - Nafisa: Yes
06/11/20, 1:08 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
06/11/20, 1:08 pm - Raktim Dey: Ask this one.
06/11/20, 1:08 pm - Raktim Dey: Rational coefficients.
06/11/20, 1:09 pm - Nafisa: Yeap
06/11/20, 1:09 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
06/11/20, 1:09 pm - Nafisa: Also

06/11/20, 1:10 pm - Raktim Dey: Arre it's okay.
06/11/20, 1:11 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
06/11/20, 1:13 pm - Nafisa: Ok so we should keep squaring to get rof irrationals
06/11/20, 1:13 pm - Nafisa: This message was deleted
06/11/20, 1:13 pm - Nafisa: rid*
06/11/20, 1:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
06/11/20, 3:15 pm - Nafisa: Poochna tun
06/11/20, 3:15 pm - Nafisa: Tum*
06/11/20, 3:16 pm - Nafisa: Podcast main mereko kuch samaj nahi aata

06/11/20, 3:19 pm - Raktim Dey: .
06/11/20, 3:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Irreducibility.
06/11/20, 3:19 pm - Nafisa: Achha
06/11/20, 3:20 pm - Nafisa: Eta bapchilam
06/11/20, 3:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh.
06/11/20, 3:25 pm - Nafisa: Mereko kuch samaj nahi aaya
06/11/20, 3:25 pm - Nafisa: Not a dot
06/11/20, 3:26 pm - Raktim Dey: I understood the first part. We need to check if (x±3) or (x±9) is a factor of the polynomial.
06/11/20, 3:28 pm - Nafisa: I will make him do it again
06/11/20, 3:29 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. Next time give this one.

07/11/20, 9:45 am - Nafisa: Agar humko back substitution ke liye poocha we write gauss in detail and just that general statement?
07/11/20, 9:45 am - Nafisa: And gauss jordan how to show  step by step ?
07/11/20, 9:48 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
07/11/20, 10:07 am - Raktim Dey: I wrote in my notes toh.

07/11/20, 10:41 am - Nafisa: What you wrote is okay ,i was saying we don't need to write stey by step na, like in gauss? Becoz thats complicated
07/11/20, 10:42 am - Raktim Dey: If you are asked to write Gauss Jordan only and not Gauss elimination and it's of 10 marks, then you will have to show the initial calculations too. It depends on the marks.
07/11/20, 10:43 am - Nafisa: Wuuu
07/11/20, 10:45 am - Nafisa: Mereko nahi aata
07/11/20, 10:45 am - Nafisa: I will try tonight

20/11/20, 12:15 pm - Raktim Dey: Example of an extension which is not simple.
20/11/20, 12:15 pm - Nafisa: No he already said
20/11/20, 12:15 pm - Nafisa: Haan
20/11/20, 12:15 pm - Nafisa: But how to show simple extension in general?
20/11/20, 12:17 pm - Raktim Dey: There's no general method. It's different for different fields.
20/11/20, 12:19 pm - Nafisa: Sigh

21/11/20, 11:43 pm - Nafisa: Sending what?
21/11/20, 11:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Doubts.
21/11/20, 11:43 pm - Nafisa: Shutter-the story of Love which neither started nor ended
21/11/20, 11:43 pm - Nafisa: Achha
21/11/20, 11:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Sounds interesting.

22/11/20, 12:00 am - Nafisa: Just becoz he is frank and open ,we can't say he likes me
22/11/20, 12:01 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah, that's true.
22/11/20, 12:01 am - Raktim Dey: Anyway, he sounds nice. I didn't know this in college.
22/11/20, 12:01 am - Nafisa: I faced it na, so i know.
22/11/20, 12:01 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
22/11/20, 12:01 am - Nafisa: I kinda regret yaar
22/11/20, 12:02 am - Nafisa: I got to know Kaustuva da is such a nice person
22/11/20, 12:02 am - Nafisa: Mekhola di also
22/11/20, 12:02 am - Raktim Dey: He is?
22/11/20, 12:02 am - Nafisa: I regret not associating with them
22/11/20, 12:02 am - Nafisa: OMG! He definitely is
22/11/20, 12:02 am - Raktim Dey: I regret not talking with Srijan Da.
22/11/20, 12:03 am - Nafisa: He is so open, friendly, cool, doesn't fake stuffs like other senoirs
22/11/20, 12:03 am - Nafisa: Yeah, you bonded with him na...
22/11/20, 12:03 am - Nafisa: I realised we actually had good seniors
22/11/20, 12:03 am - Raktim Dey: Achha. I didn't know that either.
22/11/20, 12:04 am - Raktim Dey: Some. Not all.
22/11/20, 12:04 am - Nafisa: Just focused on akask types
22/11/20, 12:04 am - Raktim Dey: He is such a loser.
22/11/20, 12:04 am - Nafisa: A few but treasure they were, we missed it
22/11/20, 12:04 am - Nafisa: Yah, can you translate what he said?
22/11/20, 12:05 am - Raktim Dey: I'm sure our juniors will think that way about us too.
22/11/20, 12:05 am - Raktim Dey: That post?
22/11/20, 12:05 am - Raktim Dey: I don't have it toh.
22/11/20, 12:05 am - Nafisa: 😂😂Did you talk to one?
22/11/20, 12:05 am - Raktim Dey: I talk to Aritra.
22/11/20, 12:05 am - Nafisa: Haan wait i think i have
22/11/20, 12:06 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
22/11/20, 12:06 am - Nafisa: Cool kid.
22/11/20, 12:06 am - Raktim Dey: Aritra is intelligent. He is very updated on politics.
22/11/20, 12:06 am - Nafisa: Nice
22/11/20, 12:06 am - Nafisa: I kinda got close to Anusree
22/11/20, 12:07 am - Nafisa: Not close but yeah, she comes to me if she needs something
22/11/20, 12:09 am - Raktim Dey: He said that it took him 20 minutes to figure out if he's a guy or a girl(which is probably because of his eyesight and the fact that he's so dumb). It takes him 30 minutes more to realise that if Indian girls like these girly guys, then he wishes he could have been born as a girl( I mean let's face it, he was Tanu's ex boyfriend. So naturally he wants to be a girl so that he doesn't have to be with her again). Why didn't he die before seeing this(I wish he did).

27/11/20, 12:53 pm - Raktim Dey: He didn't explain.
27/11/20, 12:53 pm - Nafisa: Nothing
27/11/20, 12:53 pm - Nafisa: Proof bhi galat tha
27/11/20, 12:53 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.

27/11/20, 12:54 pm - Nafisa: Hope se
28/11/20, 12:30 pm - Nafisa: How do we know if unit normal is outward or inward?
28/11/20, 12:31 pm - Nafisa: Dekhna
28/11/20, 12:31 pm - Raktim Dey: Wait.
28/11/20, 12:33 pm - Raktim Dey: We're finding out the surface integral over S'. It is at the bottom. So the normal towards it is in the negative direction.
28/11/20, 12:35 pm - Nafisa: Wo nahi re
28/11/20, 12:35 pm - Nafisa: In every sum he did ,he said unit normal outward
28/11/20, 12:35 pm - Nafisa: Kese bolta hain wo ?
28/11/20, 12:36 pm - Raktim Dey: It is always taken outward. It's a vector field, so direction matters.
28/11/20, 12:37 pm - Nafisa: So never taken inward?
28/11/20, 12:37 pm - Raktim Dey: No.
28/11/20, 12:37 pm - Raktim Dey: If it's taken inward, it will be negative na.
28/11/20, 12:39 pm - Nafisa: Ok
28/11/20, 12:40 pm - Nafisa: I will study later
28/11/20, 12:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.

13/12/20, 11:40 am - Raktim Dey: Okay.
13/12/20, 11:41 am - Nafisa: P is orthogonal means the columns have to be orthonornal
13/12/20, 11:41 am - Nafisa: Orthonormal*
13/12/20, 11:41 am - Raktim Dey: Okay. I'll remember that.
13/12/20, 11:41 am - Nafisa: I said then it becomes very complicated ,he said that it will be

16/12/20, 7:57 pm - Nafisa: So its the same thing
16/12/20, 7:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Good. Remember these conversions.
16/12/20, 7:59 pm - Raktim Dey: This conversion is different for different domains. Like when you convert dA to Dr dtheta, it's different. When you go from dV to dxdydz, it's different.
16/12/20, 8:01 pm - Nafisa: Achha
16/12/20, 8:01 pm - Nafisa: Let me reach there, i thought different domains is not in syllabus
16/12/20, 8:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Different domain matlab R² and R³. Surface integral and volume integral.
16/12/20, 8:02 pm - Nafisa: I just started bro
16/12/20, 8:02 pm - Nafisa: Let me study more
16/12/20, 8:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah yeah, okay.

16/12/20, 8:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
16/12/20, 9:08 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
16/12/20, 9:09 pm - Raktim Dey: (6³-12-2³+4)*3=(220-20)*3=600.
16/12/20, 9:10 pm - Nafisa: Okay so, dx first?
16/12/20, 9:10 pm - Raktim Dey: You can do both together there, because y is not there in the expression.
16/12/20, 9:11 pm - Nafisa: Got it
16/12/20, 9:11 pm - Nafisa: So, when we write in terms of d thita and dr
16/12/20, 9:12 pm - Nafisa: We can write anything before and we actually do the integration together?
16/12/20, 9:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
16/12/20, 9:12 pm - Nafisa: Can i send you few songs?
16/12/20, 9:12 pm - Raktim Dey: The mixed partial derivatives are continuous here, so dxdy=dydx.
16/12/20, 9:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
16/12/20, 9:13 pm - Nafisa: Okay

17/12/20, 1:34 am - Nafisa: Sem 2 main i didn't have arrear
17/12/20, 1:34 am - Raktim Dey: I know, but to be honest, Dipanjan should never be trusted.
17/12/20, 1:35 am - Nafisa: O GOD!! I know this ,since the beginning
17/12/20, 1:35 am - Nafisa: I talked to him once and there was one thing he told
17/12/20, 1:35 am - Raktim Dey: You mean you thought Dipanjan will help them in analysis arrear?
17/12/20, 1:35 am - Nafisa: From then i was like this guy is not right
17/12/20, 1:36 am - Raktim Dey: How can anyone be so naive?? Obviously he won't.

17/12/20, 1:38 am - Raktim Dey: Dipanjan and I used to go to metro together in sem 2.
17/12/20, 1:38 am - Nafisa: Yes
17/12/20, 1:38 am - Nafisa: .
17/12/20, 1:38 am - Nafisa: I know it changes
17/12/20, 1:38 am - Nafisa: You can tell me
17/12/20, 1:38 am - Raktim Dey: He's not a friend anymore.
17/12/20, 1:39 am - Nafisa: Why?
17/12/20, 1:39 am - Raktim Dey: He said something rude to me once. Back in sem 3.
17/12/20, 1:39 am - Nafisa: Okay
17/12/20, 1:40 am - Raktim Dey: And I don't like him. I know him very well. I know what he does and why he does.
17/12/20, 1:40 am - Nafisa: Exactly
17/12/20, 1:40 am - Nafisa: I wanted to call him and shout at him
17/12/20, 1:40 am - Nafisa: But Sej said not to
17/12/20, 1:40 am - Raktim Dey: Don't do that.
17/12/20, 1:41 am - Raktim Dey: Just cut him off completely. Ignore him.
17/12/20, 1:41 am - Nafisa: Becoz i don't like someone using my friends
17/12/20, 1:41 am - Nafisa: I always do
17/12/20, 1:41 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
17/12/20, 1:41 am - Nafisa: I never ask him for help in studies too, whenever i have doubts i prefer asking someone else
17/12/20, 1:42 am - Nafisa: I just don't like his fakeness
17/12/20, 1:42 am - Nafisa: He is so partial
17/12/20, 1:42 am - Raktim Dey: I don't talk to him at all. Once in a while, he asks me questions and sometimes I help him.
17/12/20, 1:42 am - Raktim Dey: I know.
17/12/20, 1:42 am - Raktim Dey: He is very egotistical.
17/12/20, 1:42 am - Nafisa: Yes
17/12/20, 1:42 am - Raktim Dey: And rude.
17/12/20, 1:42 am - Nafisa: So much
17/12/20, 1:42 am - Nafisa: And he don't mind showing it all
17/12/20, 1:43 am - Raktim Dey: He is egotistical about how smart he is.
17/12/20, 1:43 am - Nafisa: I wanted to remove him from long term gamblers
17/12/20, 1:43 am - Nafisa: He isn't
17/12/20, 1:43 am - Nafisa: Since long, but sej and all consider him friend
17/12/20, 1:44 am - Raktim Dey: He was in sem 1 and 2. At that time, he used to get more marks than I did. I used to ask him for help and he used to say he doesn't know this and that. But he asked me for help and I helped him. After sem 3, it changed. I mean, he started getting less marks than I did. And then he constantly kept asking me doubts and I always helped him. But still he rarely helped me back. So I understood what he was like.
17/12/20, 1:45 am - Nafisa: Wtf
17/12/20, 1:45 am - Nafisa: This competitive behaviour in toxic way i don't like
17/12/20, 1:46 am - Nafisa: You know but he helps Anusua and Sagarika
17/12/20, 1:46 am - Nafisa: Idk why
17/12/20, 1:46 am - Raktim Dey: Who told you he helps them?
17/12/20, 1:46 am - Nafisa: Not only now, even in offline exams i saw them cheating
17/12/20, 1:47 am - Raktim Dey: I'm sure they help him too. Sagarika told me her analysis exam went good.
17/12/20, 1:47 am - Raktim Dey: Achha.
17/12/20, 1:47 am - Nafisa: Anusua told Dipanjan helped her sometimes in exams
17/12/20, 1:47 am - Raktim Dey: I don't know, Sagarika and Dipanjan has a bond since sem 1.
17/12/20, 1:47 am - Raktim Dey: Wow.
17/12/20, 1:47 am - Nafisa: Yes
17/12/20, 1:47 am - Nafisa: Arey wahi, he might be getting back help for sure
17/12/20, 1:48 am - Raktim Dey: Definitely.
17/12/20, 1:48 am - Nafisa: Bohot matlabi hain wo
17/12/20, 1:48 am - Nafisa: I hate this
17/12/20, 1:48 am - Raktim Dey: Once college ends, you won't hear from him again.
17/12/20, 1:48 am - Nafisa: Even i feel bad when i get low marks then others but this type of behaviour is cheap
17/12/20, 1:48 am - Nafisa: I don't want to
17/12/20, 1:49 am - Nafisa: After sem 5 i might delete his no.
17/12/20, 1:49 am - Raktim Dey: Good idea.
17/12/20, 1:49 am - Nafisa: And want to remove from ling term gamblers
17/12/20, 1:49 am - Nafisa: But that will create drama
17/12/20, 1:49 am - Nafisa: So i won't
17/12/20, 1:49 am - Raktim Dey: Hone do drama. Who cares.
17/12/20, 1:49 am - Nafisa: 😂😂
17/12/20, 1:50 am - Nafisa: Arey like Toni doesn't know anything na
17/12/20, 1:50 am - Raktim Dey: I don't think she likes him either.
17/12/20, 1:50 am - Nafisa: And somewhere she might consider him friend
17/12/20, 1:50 am - Raktim Dey: Nope.
17/12/20, 1:50 am - Nafisa: Hope so
17/12/20, 1:50 am - Raktim Dey: I doubt it.
17/12/20, 1:50 am - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
17/12/20, 1:50 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
17/12/20, 1:51 am - Raktim Dey: You have no idea how selfish Dipanjan is. Let me tell you a story.
17/12/20, 1:51 am - Raktim Dey: Don't tell anyone.
17/12/20, 1:51 am - Nafisa: Yes
17/12/20, 1:52 am - Raktim Dey: After sem 2 analysis exam, Dipanjan told Minerva and I that Sujayan told him that he was looking for a pg in Kolkata. Dipanjan told us that he was planning to get Sujayan a room in his pg, so that he can take his help when he needs. At that time, Sujayan was good in studies. He said that if Sujayan couldn't afford the pg, he'll pay for him to stay there, just so he can take his help all the time.
17/12/20, 1:54 am - Nafisa: 😂😂
17/12/20, 1:54 am - Nafisa: Wow!
17/12/20, 1:54 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
17/12/20, 1:54 am - Nafisa: Aesa flim main dekha tha
17/12/20, 1:55 am - Raktim Dey: Maybe he got the idea from a movie.
17/12/20, 1:55 am - Nafisa: Dipanjan told me stuffs about his pg , he uses his money alot
17/12/20, 1:55 am - Nafisa: Maybe
17/12/20, 1:55 am - Raktim Dey: Dipanjan is the real life version of Chatur Ramalingam from 3 idiots.
17/12/20, 1:55 am - Raktim Dey: I know. His family is rich.
17/12/20, 1:56 am - Nafisa: He keeps saying his father got so much money ,and what will his father do with it ,so he spends  it
17/12/20, 1:56 am - Nafisa: Exactly🤣🤣🤣
17/12/20, 1:56 am - Nafisa: O GODDDD

01/01/21, 12:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Write the polynomial as f(x).g(x) where they are from Z[√2][x]. Then bring a contradiction.
01/01/21, 12:43 pm - Nafisa: I did but couldn't conclude anything
01/01/21, 1:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay. I'll try it later.
01/01/21, 12:57 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
01/01/21, 12:58 pm - Nafisa: .
01/01/21, 1:02 pm - Raktim Dey: x=r cos t, y=r sin t, z= a²-r(cos t+ sint ),
0≤r≤a, 0≤t≤2π.
01/01/21, 1:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Two variables ke liye.
01/01/21, 1:07 pm - Nafisa: Where is the plane part?
01/01/21, 1:07 pm - Nafisa: How to use the plane?
01/01/21, 1:07 pm - Nafisa: Direct sphere ka parametrization for Thita and Phi aata hain, but what to do with this plane?

01/01/21, 9:59 pm - Raktim Dey: You deleted this message
01/01/21, 9:59 pm - Raktim Dey: For this one, two parameters hi hoga. Because the intersection of the plane and the sphere will be a curve.
01/01/21, 10:00 pm - Nafisa: Achha
01/01/21, 10:00 pm - Nafisa: Range of u is 0 to a 
And range of thita is 0 to 2pi na?
01/01/21, 10:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
03/01/21, 8:25 am - Nafisa: Do you what proofs TB explained from LP ,saying he left them before?

03/01/21, 12:49 pm - Nafisa: Baas?
03/01/21, 12:51 pm - Raktim Dey: No no, he did a few more. I didn't do them.
03/01/21, 12:51 pm - Raktim Dey: He did the one where bfs implies extreme pt and vice versa.
03/01/21, 12:51 pm - Nafisa: Tell na, i need names
03/01/21, 12:51 pm - Nafisa: Becoz i think latest pdf i didn't download

04/01/21, 8:28 pm - Raktim Dey: Matlab?
04/01/21, 8:29 pm - Nafisa: Btw i'm compiling those programs and not getting correct output sometimes
04/01/21, 8:29 pm - Nafisa: Why is this happening sometimes only?
04/01/21, 8:29 pm - Raktim Dey: Use diagonally dominant matrices.
04/01/21, 8:29 pm - Nafisa: Matrix can't be of size 3?
04/01/21, 8:29 pm - Nafisa: Ok
04/01/21, 8:29 pm - Raktim Dey: It's the convergence condition.

04/01/21, 8:49 pm - Raktim Dey: The solution isn't unique.
04/01/21, 9:05 pm - Nafisa: Increase the value k I mean if you are giving k<25 or something, whatever you are giving, increase that value
04/01/21, 9:05 pm - Nafisa: Or take epsilon smaller
04/01/21, 9:05 pm - Nafisa: This works
04/01/21, 9:10 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.

        She loves to have food!
           Paulie Paulie Paulie!      
She loves taking photos very much
(for example Nafisa finding the watchman, hanging like a monkey as such)!

 She is very lucky to have a friend 
                      like Nafi,
 who hides her clothes when she 
                  goes to bath!
        Paulie is very adorable!
             But not bearable!
      Sab ko bolo utne falak se
    Aaj ki party Paulie ki taraf se!


Happy Birthday Paulie!

18/02/21, 5:48 pm - Raktim Dey: I think AD is a good teacher, or atleast he used to be. He taught really well in sem 2. Sem 3 and 4 was okay. Sem 5 was a bit troubling, but I guess I managed somehow. Question paper was difficult, but I studied that much hard so it didn't seem too difficult in sem 5 exam.
18/02/21, 5:48 pm - Nafisa: Ok
18/02/21, 5:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Why?

22/02/21, 8:27 pm - Nafisa: Still have to read the topic
22/02/21, 8:27 pm - Raktim Dey: I was writing an example of encrypting a message and I used the sentence"KNIFE UNDER TABLE". Then I'd encrypt it. So I'm thinking that when I have to present, if I have to present in front of RI and GT, when I'm explaining this cipher, I'll pretend to search under the table and check that there's no knife there.
22/02/21, 8:28 pm - Raktim Dey: I haven't finished reading yet. I only wrote the easy part.
22/02/21, 8:28 pm - Nafisa: Wow😂

25/02/21, 8:57 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. The first one will be equals to.
25/02/21, 8:58 pm - Raktim Dey: A=f^-1(f(A)).
25/02/21, 8:58 pm - Nafisa: Yes ,but sir said subset
25/02/21, 8:58 pm - Nafisa: Idk why
25/02/21, 8:59 pm - Raktim Dey: It will be equals. f is bijective.
25/02/21, 8:59 pm - Nafisa: Who said f is bijective?
25/02/21, 9:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Otherwise f inverse wouldn't exist.
25/02/21, 9:00 pm - Nafisa: It's not about bijection
25/02/21, 9:01 pm - Nafisa: But previously sir said even if f is not onto still  the set of pre images is the whole set
25/02/21, 9:01 pm - Nafisa: So i thought the question of bijection don't come
25/02/21, 9:01 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't know about that, but it will be equals.

25/02/21, 9:02 pm - Nafisa: Thank you
25/02/21, 9:03 pm - Nafisa: But oye, f inverse can't exist if f is not bijectice na

25/02/21, 9:04 pm - Nafisa: Then why did sir say even though if f is not onto and all
25/02/21, 9:04 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm not sure. I don't remember.

25/02/21, 9:05 pm - Nafisa: No
25/02/21, 9:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh. Yeah, I did.
25/02/21, 9:05 pm - Nafisa: Sem 1?
25/02/21, 9:06 pm - Raktim Dey: I thought you meant set relations and all that.
25/02/21, 9:06 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
25/02/21, 9:06 pm - Nafisa: No
25/02/21, 9:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I did.
25/02/21, 9:06 pm - Nafisa: You didn't ask all these questions to yourself?
25/02/21, 9:07 pm - Nafisa: What I asked you?
25/02/21, 9:07 pm - Raktim Dey: I assumed he made a mistake. I wrote equals in my copy.
25/02/21, 9:07 pm - Nafisa: You took f to be bijective through out?
25/02/21, 9:07 pm - Raktim Dey: f is bijective anyway.
25/02/21, 9:07 pm - Nafisa: 😂what about him explaining the whole thing
25/02/21, 9:07 pm - Nafisa: I need to ask him
25/02/21, 9:07 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh. Okay.
25/02/21, 9:08 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm not saying f is bijective from X to Y. f is bijective from X to f(X).
25/02/21, 9:08 pm - Nafisa: Remember I asked sir how is f-1(V)=X, there he said even if f is not onto, f inverse is the whole set X
25/02/21, 9:09 pm - Nafisa: 😒
25/02/21, 9:09 pm - Nafisa: Chutiya
25/02/21, 9:09 pm - Nafisa: Phele bolna chahiye Tha na

26/02/21, 1:10 am - Raktim Dey: Sure.
26/02/21, 1:10 am - Nafisa: The Abandoned Rooms where   
                   I Lost in Past

I have seen rooms,many rooms,
    small,big,vast and never ending,
but I entered the abandoned rooms,
and now there is no joy pending.
They were not extinct like now,
but they have occupied my heart
which I never got to know how,
and will stay with me till last berth.
The memories are now fading,
but I am still remembering.
The melodies and coldness of North,
The romance and freshness in East
The mystery and waiting in West,
The fun,freedom and love of South,
but nothing can be now tasted by my mouth.
There's still the centre,but empty
I don't see it as I feel lonely.
Never did I drink because my life seems alcoholic,
never did I smoke because happiness sweats out of me every moment just like fog in air.
Once I was forced to make a move
which lured me to make a choice,
the move made my grave,
the choice made me rejoice,
but I didn't know that the choice was the death.
Life and time are such competitors,
time will make life win and life will let time go.
The present which once healed me
is now covering me with frost,
The daylight which I see,
enters my shell to increase my cost.
The raindrops are no more,
the sunny afternoons are gone,
the cold nights are now nightmares
every time I am falling from the stair.
I have lost in the past,
in greed and absence of lovely lust.
The decaying curve has finally touched the x-axis,
now it will go down till the parenthesis.
Only South is left to support me,
but may be for may.
I entered those rooms with curiosity and got hope and joy,
but they betrayed me as they ran away with time.
I was ok till the function was at least zero,but now the function is erased till zero.
I still remember the heavenly rooms where my smile would cast,
I am now out of the abandoned rooms where I lost in past.

28/02/21, 11:56 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
28/02/21, 11:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Arre, that doesn't mean it's the constant. After you integrate the dy/dx =phi equation, you replace the integration constant with zi.
28/02/21, 11:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Or eta.
28/02/21, 11:59 pm - Nafisa: Can you please do that calculation part and send

08/03/21, 11:12 pm - Nafisa: Kinda
08/03/21, 11:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Can you ask her if everything is okay with Sagarika, but ask it casually, so that neither of them understands that I'm asking.
08/03/21, 11:14 pm - Nafisa: I can ask that to Sagarika direct, because i talk to her
08/03/21, 11:14 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, that would be okay. But ask casually.
08/03/21, 11:14 pm - Nafisa: And kya hua, Sagarika and me we just had a talk, she seemed ok
08/03/21, 11:14 pm - Raktim Dey: She stopped talking to me, replying my messages and blocked me on Instagram.
08/03/21, 11:15 pm - Raktim Dey: Don't ask her about this.
08/03/21, 11:15 pm - Nafisa: Blocked?
08/03/21, 11:15 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
08/03/21, 11:15 pm - Nafisa: Baabre
08/03/21, 11:15 pm - Raktim Dey: I even called her many times. She never picked up.

08/03/21, 11:17 pm - Raktim Dey: I have no idea what that problem could be.
08/03/21, 11:18 pm - Nafisa: And its bothering you?
08/03/21, 11:18 pm - Raktim Dey: Obviously. Yeah.
08/03/21, 11:19 pm - Nafisa: So asking casually How are you Sagarika won't help, becoz she is talking to me and she sounds completely fine
08/03/21, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. Never mind. Don't ask anything. It would be weird.
08/03/21, 11:20 pm - Nafisa: It won't

08/03/21, 11:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I guessed that.
08/03/21, 11:21 pm - Nafisa: I can ask her direct what went wrong with you.
08/03/21, 11:21 pm - Raktim Dey: No no.
08/03/21, 11:21 pm - Nafisa: What? Becoz of project she is not talking to you?
08/03/21, 11:21 pm - Raktim Dey: No no, that you're talking to her because of the project.
08/03/21, 11:22 pm - Nafisa: Achha
08/03/21, 11:22 pm - Nafisa: Bro , you can ask Anusua, what went wrong, becoz when something bothers  ,get it out.
08/03/21, 11:23 pm - Nafisa: Becoz you don't want me to ask
08/03/21, 11:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
08/03/21, 11:23 pm - Nafisa: This okay means you will do it or just to shut my mouth?

08/03/21, 11:27 pm - Raktim Dey: This okay means I'll ask Anusua.
08/03/21, 11:28 pm - Nafisa: Good
08/03/21, 11:30 pm - Nafisa: If you and Sagarika had no differences before she blocked you, then maybe she is doing it to get your attention
08/03/21, 11:30 pm - Nafisa: What i think
08/03/21, 11:32 pm - Raktim Dey: No no, it's not that.
08/03/21, 11:33 pm - Nafisa: Maybe not
08/03/21, 11:33 pm - Nafisa: Hope Anusua gives a hint
08/03/21, 11:34 pm - Nafisa: And try letting it be(which is difficult ), that will  be best for you.

16/03/21, 9:21 pm - Nafisa: Very well.
16/03/21, 9:22 pm - Nafisa: I hate AD for setting so tuff questions
16/03/21, 9:22 pm - Nafisa: So even if he is that good, it boils down to AD is also shit

16/03/21, 9:26 pm - Nafisa: Nvm
16/03/21, 9:27 pm - Raktim Dey: Arre, I know. I'm not saying that he should give tough questions. But DS gave easy questions in sem 5 and look what happened. Everyone copied everything.
16/03/21, 9:29 pm - Nafisa: Even i did
16/03/21, 9:29 pm - Nafisa: 💁‍♀️
16/03/21, 9:29 pm - Nafisa: Huh!  I like moderate questions.

16/03/21, 9:30 pm - Nafisa: I could do them
16/03/21, 9:31 pm - Raktim Dey: DS isbar easy nahi dega. He's not even sharing his document because of this.
16/03/21, 9:31 pm - Raktim Dey: AD ka easy ho bhi sakta hai.
16/03/21, 9:32 pm - Nafisa: Good. Easy nahi dega toh i will die,  he himself doesn't know anything
16/03/21, 9:32 pm - Nafisa: No comments
16/03/21, 9:32 pm - Nafisa: Nice song

16/03/21, 9:36 pm - Nafisa: Dissertation is smooth
16/03/21, 9:37 pm - Nafisa: We are only three of us and don't have to finish any syllabus
16/03/21, 9:37 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
16/03/21, 9:37 pm - Raktim Dey: That sounds like fun.😂

17/03/21, 12:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Why was DS laughing?
17/03/21, 12:45 pm - Nafisa: Ben said 2D wave equation
17/03/21, 12:45 pm - Nafisa: About saikat ka moustache

17/03/21, 7:37 pm - Nafisa: Sir asked me why was i asking him
17/03/21, 7:38 pm - Nafisa: Did he ask you like that?
17/03/21, 7:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.

17/03/21, 7:52 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
17/03/21, 8:06 pm - Nafisa: Bro
17/03/21, 8:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Bolo.
17/03/21, 8:06 pm - Nafisa: As i was saying what happens from 2a to 0
17/03/21, 8:07 pm - Nafisa: I did the integration and saw the required equation didn't come
17/03/21, 8:07 pm - Nafisa: So that means we have to take it at any point before reaching x axis?
17/03/21, 8:07 pm - Nafisa: Did you get my question?
17/03/21, 8:07 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I think I did.
17/03/21, 8:08 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes, you can't just take it to 0. Because then you won't get the value of y.
17/03/21, 8:08 pm - Raktim Dey: You have to take it from 2a to some y.
17/03/21, 8:08 pm - Nafisa: To get the value of y
17/03/21, 8:08 pm - Nafisa: Okayyyy
17/03/21, 8:08 pm - Nafisa: Got it
17/03/21, 8:08 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
18/03/21, 10:38 am - Nafisa: You listening?
18/03/21, 10:39 am - Raktim Dey: Yes.
18/03/21, 10:39 am - Nafisa: If yes why did he say X and Y are sequentially compact
18/03/21, 10:39 am - Nafisa: Compact=>seq.  Comp
18/03/21, 10:39 am - Nafisa: ?
18/03/21, 10:39 am - Nafisa: <=>*
18/03/21, 10:40 am - Raktim Dey: Yes.
18/03/21, 10:40 am - Raktim Dey: Those set of statements were equivalent.
18/03/21, 10:40 am - Nafisa: Ok
18/03/21, 11:34 am - Nafisa: Elementary mass kese dhunte hain?
19/03/21, 1:03 pm - Raktim Dey: AD ne kal ek cheez galar karaya tha.
19/03/21, 2:57 pm - Nafisa: Ok
19/03/21, 2:57 pm - Raktim Dey: You okay?
19/03/21, 6:39 pm - Nafisa: Idk
19/03/21, 6:39 pm - Nafisa: It took you one day to reply to my text? You were okay?
19/03/21, 6:41 pm - Raktim Dey: I didn't reply because Sourajyoti said the answer in class and I thought you heard.
19/03/21, 6:41 pm - Nafisa: Yeah but you could say now you know
19/03/21, 6:41 pm - Nafisa: Like you always do
19/03/21, 6:42 pm - Raktim Dey: I forgot the question.😂
19/03/21, 6:42 pm - Nafisa: Bleh
19/03/21, 6:42 pm - Nafisa: Nvm
19/03/21, 6:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Why didn't you attend classes?
19/03/21, 6:42 pm - Nafisa: Classes?
19/03/21, 6:42 pm - Nafisa: It was just TB
19/03/21, 6:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. That one.
19/03/21, 6:43 pm - Nafisa: I'm trying to mend my days.
19/03/21, 6:44 pm - Nafisa: So thought of not attending TB as I'm already lacking behind
19/03/21, 6:44 pm - Nafisa: But then it didn't bring any difference
19/03/21, 6:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
19/03/21, 6:46 pm - Nafisa: You left me on seen after i asked a question for the first time yesterday, i felt angry.(just telling you) when you texted about AD i wanted to do the same 😂
19/03/21, 6:46 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm sorry.😂
19/03/21, 6:46 pm - Raktim Dey: That was rude of me.
19/03/21, 6:46 pm - Nafisa: Chalna
19/03/21, 6:47 pm - Nafisa: Itna formality
19/03/21, 6:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Just saying.
19/03/21, 6:47 pm - Nafisa: You good?
19/03/21, 6:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
19/03/21, 6:47 pm - Nafisa: You were good?
19/03/21, 6:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I'm fine.
19/03/21, 6:47 pm - Nafisa: I started my periods too, so yeah...
19/03/21, 6:47 pm - Nafisa: Mood Tsunamis too
19/03/21, 6:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh shit.
19/03/21, 6:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Minerva ka bhi. That's why she didn't any classes today.
19/03/21, 6:48 pm - Nafisa: Sej, me and Mg we share the same cycle
19/03/21, 6:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Really? Wow.
19/03/21, 6:49 pm - Nafisa: Sej told me yesterday
19/03/21, 6:49 pm - Nafisa: Sej hates periods
19/03/21, 6:50 pm - Nafisa: But i don't mind them, untill my body doesn't ache
19/03/21, 6:50 pm - Nafisa: Bye
19/03/21, 6:50 pm - Nafisa: Otherwise i will continue
19/03/21, 6:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Is your body aching now?
19/03/21, 6:57 pm - Nafisa: Stomach, yes
19/03/21, 6:57 pm - Nafisa: Tell me from where can i study about branch cuts?
19/03/21, 6:57 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
19/03/21, 6:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Uska document dekhlo. But it's not a very important topic. You need to know the range of the principal argument (t,t+2π].
19/03/21, 6:58 pm - Nafisa: How to find branch cuts?
19/03/21, 6:59 pm - Raktim Dey: Take an axe to a tree and start chopping.
19/03/21, 6:59 pm - Raktim Dey: First 5-6 pages me hi hai wo.
19/03/21, 6:59 pm - Nafisa: Thanks, it made me laugh
19/03/21, 7:00 pm - Nafisa: Samaj nahi aaya toh
19/03/21, 7:00 pm - Raktim Dey: What exactly is the doubt?
19/03/21, 7:02 pm - Nafisa: .
19/03/21, 7:02 pm - Raktim Dey: You mean how to find the principal argument?
19/03/21, 7:03 pm - Nafisa: No
19/03/21, 7:03 pm - Raktim Dey: Principal argument is just a particular branch cut. You can find other branch cuts by adding ±2nπ to it.
19/03/21, 7:05 pm - Nafisa: Okok
19/03/21, 7:10 pm - Raktim Dey: Phirse call karo.

21/03/21, 8:19 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
21/03/21, 8:22 pm - Raktim Dey: He took z3 as the initial point in both case, that's why. Although I'm not sure if that is right.
21/03/21, 8:29 pm - Nafisa: I don't think it is
21/03/21, 8:30 pm - Nafisa: Same triangle can't have vectors ka directions different at the same time
21/03/21, 8:30 pm - Raktim Dey: It's not right.
21/03/21, 8:30 pm - Nafisa: z1z3=z3z1 is it?
21/03/21, 8:30 pm - Raktim Dey: This is the proof of the equilateral triangle?
21/03/21, 8:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
21/03/21, 8:30 pm - Nafisa: Haan, i did it
21/03/21, 8:31 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
21/03/21, 8:31 pm - Nafisa: But when i saw sir ka, he changed the directions
21/03/21, 8:31 pm - Nafisa: Pata nahi unko kya jaldi hain itna
21/03/21, 8:31 pm - Raktim Dey: If yours is correct, then don't do sir ka.

21/03/21, 8:34 pm - Nafisa: Idk sir did it
21/03/21, 8:34 pm - Nafisa: I guess he used w+w^2-1=0 wala formula
21/03/21, 8:35 pm - Raktim Dey: It's 1+ω+ω²=0.
21/03/21, 8:35 pm - Raktim Dey: Cube roots of unity.
21/03/21, 8:35 pm - Nafisa: Shit

21/03/21, 8:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, got it. Thanks.
21/03/21, 8:40 pm - Nafisa: Then we should write similarly, the other two sides are equal
21/03/21, 8:40 pm - Nafisa: Since we can represent them in terms of each other with rotations
21/03/21, 8:41 pm - Nafisa: Na?

23/03/21, 9:57 pm - Raktim Dey: It's just vectors addition rule.
23/03/21, 9:57 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
23/03/21, 9:58 pm - Raktim Dey: A and B are in the same direction, C opposite. So A+B=C.
23/03/21, 9:59 pm - Nafisa: I'm asking if its there in any book?
23/03/21, 9:59 pm - Raktim Dey: The triangle rule?
23/03/21, 9:59 pm - Nafisa: No
23/03/21, 9:59 pm - Raktim Dey: This?
23/03/21, 10:00 pm - Nafisa: Shifting if base along z axis
23/03/21, 10:00 pm - Nafisa: Yes
23/03/21, 10:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Ghosh Chakraborty me ho sakta hain. I'm not sure.

24/03/21, 12:26 pm - Nafisa: Ok
24/03/21, 7:39 pm - Nafisa: How to check if an axis is a principle axis?
24/03/21, 7:39 pm - Nafisa: AD ka part
24/03/21, 7:40 pm - Raktim Dey: The inertia matrix has to be diagonal. D=E=F=0
24/03/21, 7:40 pm - Raktim Dey: .
24/03/21, 10:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Everything okay with you?
24/03/21, 10:18 pm - Nafisa: No

24/03/21, 11:11 pm - Raktim Dey: Cube?
24/03/21, 11:11 pm - Raktim Dey: About it's diagonal?
24/03/21, 11:11 pm - Nafisa: Sorry
24/03/21, 11:11 pm - Nafisa: Yes
24/03/21, 11:12 pm - Raktim Dey: When you think of the diagonal as the axis, and the length of the side of the cube is 2a, then don't you think that the point on the extreme length will be -a, and right me a?
24/03/21, 11:12 pm - Raktim Dey: The interval being [-a,a].
24/03/21, 11:13 pm - Raktim Dey: Length of interval is 2a.
24/03/21, 11:13 pm - Raktim Dey: Agar bolta ki find inertia about a corner point, tab [0,2a] hota.
24/03/21, 11:14 pm - Nafisa: Ok
24/03/21, 11:15 pm - Raktim Dey: Samajh aya?
24/03/21, 11:42 pm - Nafisa: I understood how it happened but why?
24/03/21, 11:43 pm - Nafisa: Matlab diagonal ka 0 to 2a kiu nahi
24/03/21, 11:43 pm - Raktim Dey: When you have time, call karna. I'll explain.
24/03/21, 11:43 pm - Raktim Dey: You can call now if you want.

24/03/21, 11:44 pm - Nafisa: Okay
24/03/21, 11:45 pm - Nafisa: And that method sir used for finding eigen values, when can we use it?
24/03/21, 11:46 pm - Raktim Dey: When we are asked to find principal moments of inertia.
24/03/21, 11:47 pm - Nafisa: Achha
25/03/21, 11:17 pm - Raktim Dey: How are you?
26/03/21, 10:36 am - Nafisa: Ok

02/04/21, 11:39 am - Raktim Dey: I saw a dream that you and I went to eat at a restaurant and we ordered only one plate of biryani, and the waiter refused to give us an extra plate, so I went to argue with the restaurant staff, and then the owner came out, who was our age and kind of good looking too. He came and sat down on our table and you and he started flirting.
02/04/21, 1:02 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
02/04/21, 1:03 pm - Nafisa: This is the most unique dream i heard

06/04/21, 4:15 pm - Nafisa: Sorry I'm asking too many questions last moment pe
06/04/21, 4:15 pm - Raktim Dey: It's not defined at x =0.
06/04/21, 4:15 pm - Raktim Dey: So this holds for all x≠0.
06/04/21, 4:16 pm - Nafisa: So x=0 is absurd?
06/04/21, 4:16 pm - Nafisa: We take for all nonzero only na
06/04/21, 4:16 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, we only take for non zero x.
06/04/21, 4:17 pm - Raktim Dey: You can mention it if you want.
06/04/21, 4:17 pm - Nafisa: Hmm
06/04/21, 4:17 pm - Nafisa: Thanks alot

08/04/21, 9:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
11/04/21, 6:37 pm - Raktim Dey: How's your sunday going?
11/04/21, 7:25 pm - Nafisa: Tired.
11/04/21, 7:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Kaam kar rahe the?
11/04/21, 8:03 pm - Nafisa: You had some problem with me during the exam period?
11/04/21, 8:20 pm - Raktim Dey: Nahi toh. Kyu?
11/04/21, 8:20 pm - Raktim Dey: What happened?
11/04/21, 8:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Bolo.
11/04/21, 8:31 pm - Nafisa: I should be asking that, what happened? Whenever I asked doubts, you always seem annoyed. I knew you had problem with the cheating thing but I was always sure I have my friends, they respect my decisions as I do to theirs.                Whenever I asked doubts you felt like kiu pooch rahi hain, waise bhi she is gonna cheat?
11/04/21, 8:31 pm - Raktim Dey: When did you feel like that?
11/04/21, 8:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Mechanics exam?
11/04/21, 8:33 pm - Raktim Dey: I studied from 5 to 2am that day, Nafisa. There was so much to do.
11/04/21, 8:45 pm - Nafisa: You could just text Nafisa I can't, I would not have bothered you even once. And Abhi call nahi utha sakti, Mom ko dekhna hain.
11/04/21, 8:46 pm - Raktim Dey: When did I say you bothered me? Aisa kabhi hua hai ki you asked me for help and I said no?? Ek bar bhi?
11/04/21, 8:47 pm - Raktim Dey: I have always tried my best to help my friends no matter what. Even the night before semester exams. Yes, I do have a problem with cheating, but that doesn't mean I didn't help you or Sejuti. Have I ever said anything to you to make you feel bad about that?
11/04/21, 8:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Have I ever been rude to you about it, or when you asked for help?
11/04/21, 8:50 pm - Raktim Dey: You guys made your own group, stopped talking in the Gamblers group, and continued with your lives. Have I said anything? Everytime you all post your video call screenshots, have I said anything? Don't you think I feel bad? Don't you think I wanted to be a part of that? Who cares, right. Everyone texts me now only when they need my help. But that's fine. I won't mind. I'll keep doing that even if someone in not my friend.
11/04/21, 9:32 pm - Nafisa: Your replies made me feel as if I was bothering you and you had a problem, thats why I asked.
11/04/21, 9:38 pm - Nafisa: I guess You know what I'm going through since few months, and about the group thing we made it for cheating and Hostel people we always had a group from 1st year. Gamblers main it wasn't us who stopped talking, it was just that no kme used to reply with the same enthusiast, so we stopped texting there, and If you talk about me I had left all groups because I'm not in a state. The fucking video calls are random. I don't add you because i know you are not uncomfortable with Ben and all, do we not talk over calls, do we not ? When i was in a right state of mind was I not the one to text you everyday with some random topics?  Did i not? Be it just saying Raktim I applied nail paint. How did you say we started our lives just like that?  You are always part of my life. Always. All the I Love you Raktim was not for sake okay. You mean to me, you fucking do,thats why your odd behavior affected me. I didn't sleep that night.
11/04/21, 9:40 pm - Raktim Dey: So why would you think I was rude to you? I am very rude to a lot of people but I've never been rude to you ever. Maybe jokingly with Sejuti, but never with you.
11/04/21, 9:40 pm - Nafisa: And i had no clue you had complaints with video calls. Because you never told me. You never did. Agar bolta i would have told you why i didn't add you, because you not comfortable with them nor they are. So, and these days i barely get good times, barely get peace. So everything automatically affects me more than usual. So i thought of asking you.
11/04/21, 9:41 pm - Nafisa: Your replies were odd, not like before and i knew you had problem with cheating, so i thought of asking you if you were having any problem with me, because i was hurt.
11/04/21, 9:42 pm - Raktim Dey: It wasn't like that. I was just really busy that day. I'm sure you can understand. Mechanics ka paper utna bada tha. I just kept studying and studying.
11/04/21, 9:43 pm - Raktim Dey: If you thought I was rude, tab hi pooch lete. But I wasn't rude. And I didn't have any problem with you.
11/04/21, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: Unless you tell how will I know. I was struggling to study for an hour even, so I thought Raktim is there, i didn't know you weren't good. Bol deta na, you are not well, i would understand, we are friends bro.
11/04/21, 9:44 pm - Raktim Dey: It's not about being well. If you had asked me again, I would have helped you again. If you had called, I would have picked it up. You know that.
11/04/21, 9:45 pm - Nafisa: I was not in the right state of mind to ask or argue, I'm still not but i just wanted to clear it out.
11/04/21, 9:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
11/04/21, 9:45 pm - Nafisa: You replied with an okay. So, it showed you were annoyed.
11/04/21, 9:46 pm - Nafisa: And i had it back of my mind you have problem with me and cheating so it all made it...
11/04/21, 9:46 pm - Raktim Dey: I wasn't annoyed. I just reply that sometimes when I don't know what else to say.
11/04/21, 9:48 pm - Nafisa: Was there even one time when i asked doubts and you felt kiu pooch rahi hain cheating hi karegi?  You will be honest, even Mg was asked and she was honest. So i wanna  hear it from you also because its disturbing me.
11/04/21, 9:48 pm - Raktim Dey: You're asking if I felt that when you asked me any doubt?
11/04/21, 9:48 pm - Nafisa: Hmm
11/04/21, 9:49 pm - Raktim Dey: No.
11/04/21, 9:49 pm - Nafisa: Others times?
11/04/21, 9:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Not with you.
11/04/21, 9:49 pm - Nafisa: And you feel used?
11/04/21, 9:49 pm - Raktim Dey: No.
11/04/21, 9:50 pm - Nafisa: You think i talk to you for help only?
11/04/21, 9:50 pm - Raktim Dey: That was not about you.
11/04/21, 9:50 pm - Raktim Dey: I said a lot of things there, most of it wasn't about you. But I was angry so I just said it all.
11/04/21, 9:51 pm - Nafisa: Yes, you should tell sometimes. Like everything. It clears stuff.
11/04/21, 9:51 pm - Raktim Dey: It's not easy for me.
11/04/21, 9:51 pm - Raktim Dey: I have a hard time communicating with people.
11/04/21, 9:52 pm - Nafisa: I will wait then
11/04/21, 9:52 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
11/04/21, 9:52 pm - Nafisa: But atleast anytime you have something, you ask me ok. Like i asked you today.
11/04/21, 9:53 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I will.
11/04/21, 9:53 pm - Nafisa: I had no idea about the video call thing.
11/04/21, 9:53 pm - Raktim Dey: It's not really a big deal. I was just angry, so I said whatever came to my mind.
11/04/21, 9:54 pm - Nafisa: Actually I'm divided between you,mg and Sej and paul, ben and archie. But since sej is close to ben she eventually got close to the group also, becoz of the cheating group and all.
11/04/21, 9:54 pm - Raktim Dey: It's fine. It's understandable.
11/04/21, 9:55 pm - Nafisa: I hate video calls btw. Its always randkm
11/04/21, 9:55 pm - Raktim Dey: I know. It's really not a big deal.
11/04/21, 9:55 pm - Nafisa: No shut up, stop being nice always
11/04/21, 9:55 pm - Nafisa: Be bad.
11/04/21, 9:55 pm - Nafisa: Its fine.
11/04/21, 9:56 pm - Nafisa: If you feel me close don't hesitate. You don't need to always act like everything is cool.
11/04/21, 9:56 pm - Nafisa: I know sometimes small things can hurt alot
11/04/21, 9:56 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
11/04/21, 9:56 pm - Nafisa: Dummbo.
11/04/21, 9:56 pm - Raktim Dey: Next time if there's anything, I'll tell you.
11/04/21, 9:56 pm - Nafisa: I cried so much that day
11/04/21, 9:56 pm - Raktim Dey: But why?
11/04/21, 9:57 pm - Nafisa: Badah aaya, dekhte hain kitna bolta hain.
11/04/21, 9:58 pm - Nafisa: Actually i already have so much from family and when you replied that way, i was like my friends also are not with me. All sorts of disappointments came. I felt you didn't respect my decision while i was so sure you never had a problem with it.
11/04/21, 9:59 pm - Nafisa: And you know what I'm very scared to argue with you
11/04/21, 10:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Look, nowadays sometimes I don't help people because I don't feel like it. But that's Debmalya or Rahul Ghosh. When it comes to you or Sejuti, I always try my best to help.
11/04/21, 10:02 pm - Raktim Dey: And about the cheating thing, it's not about you. I have a problem with it in general. About everyone. It's not only because it's wrong, but because of it, the teachers are setting more difficult questions and I have to study harder. Only yesterday TB sir said in the last class that in the end sem, questions will be coming mostly from outside, not related to notes. Plus there's the whole sgpa thing. It matters. Here I am studying so hard to get 8, and Rahul Ghosh and Debmalya are cheating and getting the same. So in times of admission for MSc, they'll get preference because of better marks even though they cheated.
11/04/21, 10:03 pm - Raktim Dey: I mean, Sreetama came first. It's s joke.
11/04/21, 10:04 pm - Nafisa: It all started becoz of the professors only. They teach so bad nd set so difficult questions, and we need marks, few of us badly needs it for masters. Even after studying and struggling so hard i get so low marks so i chose cheating
11/04/21, 10:05 pm - Nafisa: I study but also cheat
11/04/21, 10:05 pm - Nafisa: Its no one's fault. (my opinion )
11/04/21, 10:06 pm - Nafisa: Anything happened in past that you hate cheating so much?
11/04/21, 10:07 pm - Raktim Dey: I always hate it. I mean, I  could have cheated in engineering too. But I didn't. I left college and started again with mathematics by working hard. And blaming the teacher is just an excuse. It's fine if you're cheating, but don't justify it.
11/04/21, 10:09 pm - Nafisa: Everyone is not the same.
11/04/21, 10:10 pm - Nafisa: Sometimes hard work don't pay and your house situation doesn't allow you for a fresh start. And yes its not a justification or excuse but my reason why i started cheating.
11/04/21, 10:11 pm - Nafisa: Your wish how you take it, but always know everyone has their stories, their own fights, and not all can take it for long.
11/04/21, 10:13 pm - Raktim Dey: See, I told you, I don't have a problem with you cheating. Like I said, it's fine. But don't justify it. Do you think Debmalya or Mayurakshi or Rishika, they cheat because it's difficult for them? No, because it's the easier way. That's just how it is.
11/04/21, 10:14 pm - Raktim Dey: I was teaching 5 days a week during sem 4 exams and Minerva was in hospital with her mother half the day.
11/04/21, 10:15 pm - Nafisa: Don't tell me I'm justifying.
11/04/21, 10:15 pm - Nafisa: I'm not.
11/04/21, 10:15 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
11/04/21, 10:15 pm - Nafisa: I'm not as smart as you in studies
11/04/21, 10:16 pm - Nafisa: And yes its easier for Mayurakshi and all ,so what. Its their choice
11/04/21, 10:16 pm - Raktim Dey: You know I got less than in first year, right?
11/04/21, 10:16 pm - Raktim Dey: You*
11/04/21, 10:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Exactly. That's what I'm saying. It's their choice. They're not doing it because of teachers.
11/04/21, 10:17 pm - Nafisa: Okay
11/04/21, 10:17 pm - Nafisa: Lets leave it here
11/04/21, 10:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
11/04/21, 10:17 pm - Nafisa: Bye
11/04/21, 10:17 pm - Nafisa: Take care.
11/04/21, 10:18 pm - Raktim Dey: You too.
11/04/21, 10:20 pm - Nafisa: The teachers play a great role in fucking up with our marks. You wanna deny it,do .But I don't. And Yes, saying they play a role, i didn't justify. Hope you get it. If you still disagree which you do, its okay.
11/04/21, 10:25 pm - Nafisa: Things are not the same now.
11/04/21, 10:26 pm - Nafisa: Since you mentioned it, just because you don't know what i went through, you have no right to say i was in easier situation. And you don't compare things Raktim. You Don't. Its not the way.
11/04/21, 10:41 pm - Raktim Dey: I am not comparing situations. I know you were in a very bad situation and you still are. I said a lot of stupid things. I'm sorry about it.
11/04/21, 10:43 pm - Raktim Dey: I had a lot of misplaced anger about other people and when you said you thought I was ignoring you, I got angry and I said some things without thinking about what you were going through. I'm sorry about that.
11/04/21, 11:15 pm - Nafisa: Always know that you matter to me.                     Take care.
11/04/21, 11:15 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, okay.
11/04/21, 11:15 pm - Raktim Dey: And you matter to me too. I'm sure you know that.
11/04/21, 11:16 pm - Nafisa: Know its clear.
11/04/21, 11:16 pm - Nafisa: Well not gonna cry today hopefully
11/04/21, 11:16 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
11/04/21, 11:16 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.😂
11/04/21, 11:17 pm - Raktim Dey: By the way, when did you mother get back?
11/04/21, 11:17 pm - Nafisa: Don't be stupid okay, say things out to me, we will sort it out together.
11/04/21, 11:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I will.
11/04/21, 11:17 pm - Nafisa: Yesterday.
11/04/21, 11:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
11/04/21, 11:17 pm - Raktim Dey: How is she now?
11/04/21, 11:18 pm - Nafisa: Recovery but needs alot of care and pamper.

11/04/21, 11:18 pm - Nafisa: Can't walk properly
11/04/21, 11:18 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
11/04/21, 11:18 pm - Nafisa: Yes, she has become very moody
11/04/21, 11:18 pm - Nafisa: She scolds me for no reason.
11/04/21, 11:19 pm - Raktim Dey: All mothers do that.
11/04/21, 11:19 pm - Nafisa: Dad told its the drugs
11/04/21, 11:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.

11/04/21, 11:19 pm - Raktim Dey: She'll get better soon, and tab nahi karegi aur.
11/04/21, 11:19 pm - Nafisa: She says you keep studying whenever i come near to my study table.
11/04/21, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: You do?
11/04/21, 11:20 pm - Nafisa: I'm praying
11/04/21, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
11/04/21, 11:20 pm - Nafisa: I don't get time
11/04/21, 11:20 pm - Nafisa: Its been so long i studied properly for hours
11/04/21, 11:21 pm - Raktim Dey: You're in a tough situation. Like I said before, if I was in your place, I wouldn't have been able to study either.
11/04/21, 11:21 pm - Raktim Dey: And these teachers keep teaching so much in so less time. Especially TB.
11/04/21, 11:22 pm - Nafisa: I hate TB
11/04/21, 11:22 pm - Raktim Dey: They're all bad.
11/04/21, 11:22 pm - Nafisa: I don't know how will i manage. Scared for entrances
11/04/21, 11:22 pm - Nafisa: I had planned so many things.
11/04/21, 11:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Entrances ke liye time hai. NBHM got postponed because of Covid.
11/04/21, 11:23 pm - Nafisa: Dissertation ke liye toh bilkul nahi hain

11/04/21, 11:23 pm - Raktim Dey: We are all fucked. In one way or the other.
11/04/21, 11:23 pm - Nafisa: Yes
11/04/21, 11:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Do you know what you have to write? I mean, is it prepared?

11/04/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: Like alot
11/04/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: I just got the notion.
11/04/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: I will do it. I have no choice
11/04/21, 11:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Try working on it a little bit everyday. Warna nahi hoga time pe.

13/04/21, 7:32 pm - Nafisa: Shit

13/04/21, 7:38 pm - Nafisa: And blocked me
13/04/21, 7:38 pm - Raktim Dey: That's why she didn't give you credits?
13/04/21, 7:39 pm - Nafisa: First person to block Nafisa! Can you imagine
13/04/21, 7:39 pm - Raktim Dey: I didn't vote for Sagarika but I got credits for Analytica 2018.
13/04/21, 7:39 pm - Nafisa: Nono
13/04/21, 7:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, that I know.
13/04/21, 7:39 pm - Nafisa: Not analytica
13/04/21, 7:39 pm - Nafisa: XPL
13/04/21, 7:39 pm - Raktim Dey: She blocked you, Sejuti and Minerva, but not me.😂
13/04/21, 7:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
13/04/21, 7:41 pm - Nafisa: Special Raktim!
13/04/21, 7:41 pm - Nafisa: 😏
13/04/21, 7:41 pm - Raktim Dey: That I am.
13/04/21, 7:42 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
13/04/21, 7:43 pm - Raktim Dey: She sent an Excel file of two pages.
13/04/21, 7:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Aisa hoga?
13/04/21, 7:43 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
13/04/21, 7:43 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
13/04/21, 7:43 pm - Nafisa: Synopsis bhej diya kya?
13/04/21, 7:44 pm - Nafisa: What is this? I don't need this, i need her dissertation
13/04/21, 7:44 pm - Nafisa: If she has it
13/04/21, 7:45 pm - Raktim Dey: I asked her again.
13/04/21, 7:48 pm - Nafisa: Okay

13/04/21, 8:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Bolo.
13/04/21, 8:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
13/04/21, 8:01 pm - Raktim Dey: Highly inappropriate.
13/04/21, 8:03 pm - Nafisa: It get to my nerves sometimes

13/04/21, 8:03 pm - Raktim Dey: Me neither. I don't want to argue with them. There's no point.
13/04/21, 8:04 pm - Nafisa: The rape comparison was disgusting
13/04/21, 8:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, obviously. You can't compare meat eaters to people who support rape. That's absolutely unthinkable.
13/04/21, 8:05 pm - Nafisa: Exactly
13/04/21, 10:00 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
13/04/21, 10:01 pm - Nafisa: Thank you

14/04/21, 12:02 pm - Raktim Dey: No. Why?
14/04/21, 12:02 pm - Nafisa: My stupid cousin told my father about it
14/04/21, 12:02 pm - Nafisa: So Now I'm forced to apply there
14/04/21, 12:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Did you qualify for JAM?
14/04/21, 12:02 pm - Nafisa: NO
14/04/21, 12:03 pm - Raktim Dey: Then I don't think you can.
14/04/21, 12:03 pm - Nafisa: Thats what i was telling him
14/04/21, 12:03 pm - Nafisa: Mereko nahi jaana
14/04/21, 12:03 pm - Nafisa: Jaa bhi nahi sakti
14/04/21, 12:03 pm - Raktim Dey: IISC is for those students who ranked less than 100 in JAM.
14/04/21, 12:03 pm - Nafisa: Exactly 🙂
14/04/21, 12:04 pm - Nafisa: Please tell him that
14/04/21, 12:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.😂
14/04/21, 12:04 pm - Nafisa: I hate my cousins
14/04/21, 12:04 pm - Nafisa: Can't let me live in peace
14/04/21, 12:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Cousins are the worst.
14/04/21, 12:04 pm - Nafisa: No doubt
14/04/21, 12:04 pm - Nafisa: Btw
14/04/21, 12:05 pm - Nafisa: Since yesterday I'm trying to write my intro
14/04/21, 12:05 pm - Nafisa: Idk whats wrong, I'm not liking anything
14/04/21, 12:05 pm - Raktim Dey: What's your topic?
14/04/21, 12:05 pm - Nafisa: Network flows
14/04/21, 12:06 pm - Raktim Dey: You can't find an introduction online?

21/04/21, 9:22 pm - Nafisa: Matlab i don't like people who are done with their projects so soon
21/04/21, 9:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.😂
21/04/21, 9:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Got it.
21/04/21, 9:59 pm - Raktim Dey: Can you help me with something?
21/04/21, 10:00 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
21/04/21, 10:01 pm - Raktim Dey: Can you read page 19,20 and 21 and tell me which parts you don't understand? Even any small doubt, tell me.
21/04/21, 10:07 pm - Nafisa: So I should start from page 19 na?
21/04/21, 10:07 pm - Nafisa: Ok
21/04/21, 10:13 pm - Nafisa: You used three different algorithms to solve that same example right?
21/04/21, 10:17 pm - Nafisa: Ok my doubts: page 20 is too brief, i didn't get whats happening.
21/04/21, 10:19 pm - Nafisa: Second doubt= in page 21, What happens after the computation? It ended abruptly if that was the end.
21/04/21, 10:24 pm - Raktim Dey: In page 21 wala algorithm, Alice wants to send the message "m" to Bob. So when he calculates m, it's over.
21/04/21, 10:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, more or less that.
21/04/21, 10:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay. I'll see what I can do about it.
21/04/21, 10:26 pm - Raktim Dey: Do you have any doubt about the algebra part? I mean why I'm choosing this and that.
21/04/21, 10:31 pm - Nafisa: Didn't pay heed to the math there.
21/04/21, 10:31 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
21/04/21, 10:32 pm - Nafisa: Mereko math samah nahi aaya
21/04/21, 10:32 pm - Nafisa: Its probably becoz I'm not good at algebra
21/04/21, 10:32 pm - Raktim Dey: That's fine.
21/04/21, 10:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Kya samajh nahi aya?
21/04/21, 10:33 pm - Nafisa: So, it will more clear if you mention it.
21/04/21, 10:33 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
21/04/21, 10:33 pm - Nafisa: Primitive root
21/04/21, 10:33 pm - Nafisa: Or something
21/04/21, 10:33 pm - Raktim Dey: I wrote in bracket. Primitive root mod p means generator of Zp*.
21/04/21, 10:33 pm - Nafisa: And the expression are module? It was thora diff so i thought its something I don't know
21/04/21, 10:34 pm - Raktim Dey: If Zp*=<a>, then a is a primitive root mod p.
21/04/21, 10:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, it's all congruent mod p.
21/04/21, 10:36 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
21/04/21, 10:36 pm - Nafisa: That i got it.
21/04/21, 10:37 pm - Nafisa: Okok, got it. I missed the bracket, sorry.
21/04/21, 10:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes. It works, because of the fact that a^h1h2=a^h2h1.
21/04/21, 10:41 pm - Nafisa: Okok
21/04/21, 10:42 pm - Nafisa: Then its fine
21/04/21, 10:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
21/04/21, 10:42 pm - Nafisa: Ye mention karna in page 21.
21/04/21, 10:42 pm - Nafisa: If you like
21/04/21, 10:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I'll write it.
21/04/21, 10:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Thank you.
21/04/21, 10:42 pm - Nafisa: Good
21/04/21, 10:43 pm - Nafisa: Welcome
21/04/21, 10:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
21/04/21, 10:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Did you see Tanu's status?
21/04/21, 10:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Starbucks wala?
21/04/21, 10:51 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
21/04/21, 10:54 pm - Nafisa: Yes
21/04/21, 10:54 pm - Nafisa: Now I understood
21/04/21, 10:54 pm - Nafisa: It was written Janu first😂
21/04/21, 10:55 pm - Raktim Dey: I know.😂😂
21/04/21, 10:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
21/04/21, 10:55 pm - Nafisa: Bro I'm low-key freaking out, i have planned so many things and I have got so less time.
21/04/21, 10:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Dissertation ka?
21/04/21, 10:55 pm - Nafisa: Hmm
21/04/21, 10:55 pm - Raktim Dey: How much have you written?
21/04/21, 10:56 pm - Nafisa: Two chapters
21/04/21, 10:56 pm - Raktim Dey: Aur kitna?
21/04/21, 10:56 pm - Nafisa: More two chapters and intro
21/04/21, 10:56 pm - Raktim Dey: That doesn't sound like much.
21/04/21, 10:56 pm - Nafisa: But it is
21/04/21, 10:56 pm - Raktim Dey: Are you writing everyday?
21/04/21, 10:57 pm - Nafisa: Three* i wanna add the drawbacks
21/04/21, 10:57 pm - Nafisa: Whole time
21/04/21, 10:57 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha. Word me toh?
21/04/21, 10:57 pm - Nafisa: Haan
21/04/21, 10:57 pm - Nafisa: The mathematical expressions are too many
21/04/21, 10:57 pm - Raktim Dey: Wo sab kaise likh rahe ho?
21/04/21, 10:57 pm - Nafisa: Word
21/04/21, 10:58 pm - Raktim Dey: There are online math keyboards. You can use those.
21/04/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: Your Alice and Bob thing is really nice.
21/04/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: I don't have time to search that now, technically handicapped
21/04/21, 10:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Actually, it's not an original idea. Ever since the beginning of cryptography, every writer uses those two spy characters. So I was trying to continue the tradition.😂
21/04/21, 10:59 pm - Raktim Dey: I'll send you the link.
21/04/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: Nice
21/04/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: Thanks but i will probably not know how to use it
21/04/21, 10:59 pm - Raktim Dey: https://usefulwebtool.com/math-keyboard
21/04/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: Chal bye. This Ramzan messed up more things for me
21/04/21, 10:59 pm - Raktim Dey: It's simple. Just go and check.
21/04/21, 11:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, okay.
21/04/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: I already had so much but God wasn't happy
21/04/21, 11:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Well, you can never really please God completely. So it's better to please yourself.
21/04/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
21/04/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: Chal Gn for two hours
21/04/21, 11:01 pm - Raktim Dey: Bye.

23/04/21, 12:17 pm - Nafisa: Ok so i have a question, why he goes from page 78 to 200somethingn
23/04/21, 12:18 pm - Raktim Dey: The problems are in page 78. The method of solving them, separation of variables is in that 200 something.
23/04/21, 12:18 pm - Nafisa: Ok
23/04/21, 12:18 pm - Nafisa: Thanks
23/04/21, 12:20 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>

04/05/21, 9:54 pm - Raktim Dey: Not much studying.
04/05/21, 9:55 pm - Nafisa: Not a reason to convince him
04/05/21, 9:55 pm - Nafisa: I will tell him, Applied Math nahi hain
04/05/21, 9:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Not much chance of placement.

04/05/21, 9:57 pm - Nafisa: Perks of having too strict Dad. You become a pro in acting
04/05/21, 9:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I understand.😂
04/05/21, 9:58 pm - Nafisa: Goodnight
04/05/21, 9:58 pm - Nafisa: Tomorrow I want some tips on how to prepare for entrance, these type of studying I do will not work. So, thora idea dena kal Tintin😂
04/05/21, 9:59 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, okay.😂
04/05/21, 9:59 pm - Nafisa: I can't get over it

04/05/21, 9:59 pm - Raktim Dey: Bye, Nafisa.
04/05/21, 9:59 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
06/05/21, 11:31 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
06/05/21, 11:31 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
06/05/21, 11:32 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
06/05/21, 12:06 pm - Raktim Dey: You deleted this message
06/05/21, 12:07 pm - Raktim Dey: Write (4,-5,9,-7)=c1α1+c2α2+c2α3. You'll get four equations. Now solve for c1,c2,c3.
06/05/21, 12:08 pm - Raktim Dey: αv1+βv2 is linear combination of v1 and v2, so they are linearly independent.
06/05/21, 12:16 pm - Raktim Dey: Linearly dependent.*
06/05/21, 1:04 pm - Nafisa: Solving part only couldn't do
06/05/21, 1:05 pm - Nafisa: Just this statement will work? How to show it?
06/05/21, 1:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Bas itna hi. This is enough toh.
06/05/21, 1:06 pm - Nafisa: Can you help?
06/05/21, 1:06 pm - Nafisa: This too.
06/05/21, 1:06 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm doing it.
06/05/21, 1:06 pm - Nafisa: Whenever you can
06/05/21, 1:07 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
06/05/21, 1:09 pm - Nafisa: Its not said find the scalars na
06/05/21, 1:09 pm - Nafisa: Its told show that is a linear span, instead of showing why did you take it right away
06/05/21, 1:11 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
06/05/21, 1:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Aise hi dikhate hai.
06/05/21, 1:14 pm - Raktim Dey: Showing a linear span means you have to find the scalars.
06/05/21, 1:56 pm - Nafisa: And the scalars have to be non zero?
06/05/21, 2:01 pm - Raktim Dey: All of them can't be zero.
06/05/21, 6:26 pm - Nafisa: Ok
07/05/21, 11:51 am - Nafisa: Koi applications nikla?
07/05/21, 11:55 am - Raktim Dey: Naya kuch nahi. Wahi CMI aur Ramkrishna Mission ka.

07/05/21, 12:00 pm - Raktim Dey: DU ka shayad June me, but not confirmed.
07/05/21, 12:00 pm - Nafisa: You are applying in qutie alot of places
07/05/21, 12:01 pm - Raktim Dey: I won't apply in DU or Hyderabad if I get into an IISER.
07/05/21, 12:01 pm - Nafisa: You will leave Kolkata if you get outside? What will Aunty do?
07/05/21, 12:01 pm - Raktim Dey: She can manage than I can.

07/05/21, 12:03 pm - Raktim Dey: No no, I'll manage.😂
07/05/21, 12:03 pm - Nafisa: Yes
07/05/21, 12:03 pm - Nafisa: Tell me how do I prepare?
07/05/21, 12:03 pm - Raktim Dey: For which college?
07/05/21, 12:04 pm - Nafisa: For all these entrances
07/05/21, 12:04 pm - Raktim Dey: You need to study continuity, differentiation really well from Mapa.
07/05/21, 12:04 pm - Raktim Dey: For algebra, vector space Mapa se achhe se padho. And group theory ho sake toh Dummit Foote padho.
07/05/21, 12:05 pm - Raktim Dey: And solve previous years questions.
07/05/21, 12:05 pm - Nafisa: I'm doing vector space now
07/05/21, 12:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
07/05/21, 12:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Diagonalisation is very important.
07/05/21, 12:05 pm - Nafisa: RI really taught well
07/05/21, 12:05 pm - Raktim Dey: But AD fucked up in sem 4.
07/05/21, 12:06 pm - Nafisa: Lets talk about good things
07/05/21, 12:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
07/05/21, 12:06 pm - Nafisa: Not fake people

07/05/21, 12:06 pm - Nafisa: So fake he is
07/05/21, 12:06 pm - Nafisa: You so lonely?
07/05/21, 12:06 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂😂

07/05/21, 12:06 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
07/05/21, 12:06 pm - Raktim Dey: I called GT and his wife picked up. It was so awkward.
07/05/21, 12:07 pm - Nafisa: Ask for her number
07/05/21, 12:07 pm - Raktim Dey: Why!
07/05/21, 12:07 pm - Raktim Dey: ?
07/05/21, 12:07 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't need her number. GT's number is enough.
07/05/21, 12:07 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
07/05/21, 12:08 pm - Nafisa: Loneliness
07/05/21, 12:08 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
07/05/21, 12:08 pm - Raktim Dey: Quadratic form nahi hai.
07/05/21, 12:08 pm - Nafisa: How you know, its written vector space only toh
07/05/21, 12:08 pm - Raktim Dey: See, vector space wala chapter yaha se padho, linear transformation bhi. But diagonalisation ke liye study Friedberg.
07/05/21, 12:08 pm - Raktim Dey: Or Artin
07/05/21, 12:08 pm - Raktim Dey: .
07/05/21, 12:09 pm - Nafisa: Diagonilisation Hyderabad ke syllabus main nahi hain
07/05/21, 12:09 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha. Phir chhor do.
07/05/21, 12:10 pm - Raktim Dey: CMI ke maths exam me hai.
07/05/21, 12:10 pm - Nafisa: Math nahi de rahi
07/05/21, 12:10 pm - Nafisa: Complex parina
07/05/21, 12:10 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha. Data Science then.
07/05/21, 12:10 pm - Nafisa: Hmm
07/05/21, 12:10 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
07/05/21, 12:10 pm - Nafisa: But stats nahi aata
07/05/21, 12:10 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm still confused, math exam du ki data science.
07/05/21, 12:10 pm - Nafisa: Under confidence se bhi neeche hain confidence

07/05/21, 12:11 pm - Nafisa: I have to prepare really well
07/05/21, 12:11 pm - Nafisa: So that I get atleast in one college
07/05/21, 12:12 pm - Nafisa: Kahi nahi milla toh i will be fucked
07/05/21, 12:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Are, kahi na kahi mil jayega, definitely.
07/05/21, 12:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Hyderabad toh hai.
07/05/21, 12:12 pm - Nafisa: Can you imagine I started studying now. You guys are doing it from so long
07/05/21, 12:12 pm - Raktim Dey: For entrance?
07/05/21, 12:12 pm - Nafisa: Yes
07/05/21, 12:13 pm - Raktim Dey: I was studying for different exams. The upcoming ones are different.
07/05/21, 12:13 pm - Nafisa: College exam ke baare main bhul hi gayi
07/05/21, 12:13 pm - Nafisa: 🥲
07/05/21, 12:13 pm - Raktim Dey: Yup. I'm studying that only. Complex analysis.
07/05/21, 12:14 pm - Raktim Dey: Atleast wo entrances me ayega.
07/05/21, 12:14 pm - Nafisa: I will not study until i get routine
07/05/21, 12:14 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm spending the least amount of time on mechanics.
07/05/21, 12:14 pm - Nafisa: Konse college mainn?
07/05/21, 12:14 pm - Raktim Dey: CMI math. Only that. And NBHM.
07/05/21, 12:14 pm - Nafisa: Hmm
07/05/21, 12:14 pm - Nafisa: Mereko mechanics padhna hoga
07/05/21, 12:15 pm - Nafisa: Agar applied wale colleges mil gaye then they have mechanics
07/05/21, 12:15 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm just studying for passing this time, literally. I don't need good marks.
07/05/21, 12:15 pm - Raktim Dey: Not necessarily. Mechanics is physics related.
07/05/21, 12:15 pm - Raktim Dey: Mechanics.
07/05/21, 12:15 pm - Nafisa: Nobody wants good marks. I swear. At this point we just wanna leave
07/05/21, 12:15 pm - Raktim Dey: Wahi.
07/05/21, 12:15 pm - Nafisa: I saw syllabus
07/05/21, 12:16 pm - Raktim Dey: Kis college ka?
07/05/21, 12:16 pm - Nafisa: Calcutta university ka
07/05/21, 12:16 pm - Raktim Dey: Usko rehne do. Hyderabad ta phir DU me nahi hai.
07/05/21, 12:16 pm - Nafisa: I wanna go ahead with LPP. I really like it
07/05/21, 12:17 pm - Nafisa: Operarion research bolke DS sir was saying, i will see that if i can
07/05/21, 12:17 pm - Nafisa: Aukaad se shayad bahar ho
07/05/21, 12:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Ha, there are a lot of options.
07/05/21, 12:17 pm - Nafisa: You know any?
07/05/21, 12:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Who knows. MSc ke baad it might seem simple.
07/05/21, 12:17 pm - Raktim Dey: What?
07/05/21, 12:17 pm - Nafisa: For LPP
07/05/21, 12:17 pm - Raktim Dey: College?
07/05/21, 12:18 pm - Nafisa: Uska alag sa course hota tha phele
07/05/21, 12:18 pm - Nafisa: Algorithms bolke
07/05/21, 12:18 pm - Raktim Dey: LPP ka tumhe ek paper milega almost saare applied courses me.
07/05/21, 12:18 pm - Raktim Dey: Presidency, Delhi ye sab jaga pe.
07/05/21, 12:18 pm - Raktim Dey: LPP has applications in logistics.
07/05/21, 12:18 pm - Nafisa: Delhi University ke entrances kese hote hain?
07/05/21, 12:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Application shuru nahi hua.
07/05/21, 12:19 pm - Nafisa: OMG. Numerous applications.
07/05/21, 12:19 pm - Nafisa: Application nahi, entrance se dar lagta hain mereko
07/05/21, 12:19 pm - Nafisa: DU main marks bohot chahiye na, they get 9 pointers and all
07/05/21, 12:20 pm - Raktim Dey: Maths ka thodi na waise hoga. 9 pointers go to IIT and TIFR.
07/05/21, 12:20 pm - Nafisa: Pata hain, these days I study less and worry more. I sit and barely two hours.
07/05/21, 12:20 pm - Raktim Dey: Worry about entrance?
07/05/21, 12:20 pm - Nafisa: Life itself
07/05/21, 12:20 pm - Nafisa: Sometimes Mom
07/05/21, 12:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
07/05/21, 12:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, well, I understand.
07/05/21, 12:21 pm - Raktim Dey: How is she now?
07/05/21, 12:21 pm - Nafisa: Better
07/05/21, 12:21 pm - Nafisa: But weak
07/05/21, 12:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
07/05/21, 12:21 pm - Nafisa: She needs to go again, to remove stand
07/05/21, 12:21 pm - Raktim Dey: You're still cooking and doing other works?
07/05/21, 12:21 pm - Nafisa: Fucking lockdown
07/05/21, 12:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh.
07/05/21, 12:22 pm - Nafisa: No, i just help. I don't need to do all the cooking now
07/05/21, 12:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
07/05/21, 12:22 pm - Nafisa: Project ka draft ka response milla tumko?
07/05/21, 12:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Not yet.
07/05/21, 12:23 pm - Raktim Dey: RI is absolutely useless.
07/05/21, 12:23 pm - Nafisa: Its so annoying
07/05/21, 12:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Maine GT ko check karne diya. Let's see what he says.
07/05/21, 12:23 pm - Nafisa: SR is not responding and I'm stuck
07/05/21, 12:23 pm - Nafisa: GT is better.
07/05/21, 12:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Call her. She always takes calls.
07/05/21, 12:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
07/05/21, 12:23 pm - Nafisa: Manipulative lady
07/05/21, 12:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Everytime I call, she picks up.
07/05/21, 12:24 pm - Nafisa: She talks as if I'm lacking behind and not working
07/05/21, 12:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh.
07/05/21, 12:24 pm - Nafisa: She does.
07/05/21, 12:24 pm - Raktim Dey: You submitted the draft?
07/05/21, 12:24 pm - Nafisa: She replied Ben
07/05/21, 12:24 pm - Nafisa: That annoyed me more
07/05/21, 12:25 pm - Raktim Dey: She didn't reply to you?
07/05/21, 12:25 pm - Nafisa: Its not complete. I need her help to finish it
07/05/21, 12:25 pm - Nafisa: No
07/05/21, 12:25 pm - Raktim Dey: That's not fair.
07/05/21, 12:25 pm - Nafisa: And i submitted way before Ben
07/05/21, 12:25 pm - Nafisa: Well, Yes
07/05/21, 12:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha. She shouldn't have done that.
07/05/21, 12:26 pm - Nafisa: Ben says maybe she saw his mail and it was the timing.
07/05/21, 12:26 pm - Raktim Dey: Pata nahi. Ho sakta hai.
07/05/21, 12:26 pm - Nafisa: Like she might be getting so many mails in a day
07/05/21, 12:26 pm - Raktim Dey: You need to talk to her. Only 3 days left.
07/05/21, 12:26 pm - Nafisa: That day Biswajit helped with giving numbers for Sujayan's Mom and now they got tested
07/05/21, 12:27 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
07/05/21, 12:27 pm - Nafisa: I will call her today.
07/05/21, 12:27 pm - Raktim Dey: Biswajit ne kya kiya?
07/05/21, 12:27 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
07/05/21, 12:27 pm - Nafisa: Numbers diya
07/05/21, 12:27 pm - Nafisa: I asked him
07/05/21, 12:27 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
07/05/21, 12:27 pm - Raktim Dey: Good of him.
07/05/21, 12:28 pm - Nafisa: Ayesha's Mom was critical
07/05/21, 12:28 pm - Raktim Dey: Covid?

10/05/21, 1:47 am - Raktim Dey: Wow.
10/05/21, 1:47 am - Raktim Dey: It could be awkward.
10/05/21, 1:47 am - Raktim Dey: Even if she doesn't say.
10/05/21, 1:55 am - Nafisa: I know her
10/05/21, 1:55 am - Nafisa: She is my closest friend
10/05/21, 1:55 am - Nafisa: Why would i make her awkward
10/05/21, 1:55 am - Raktim Dey: Okay then.
10/05/21, 1:56 am - Nafisa: It could be awkward if she still had anything. For her its all done. She doesn't care who he dates. Even if its me, she don't mind it.

10/05/21, 11:00 am - Nafisa: Meeting for what? Gonna explain whats taking him ages to check drafts
10/05/21, 11:01 am - Nafisa: SR didn't send a proof till now.
10/05/21, 11:01 am - Raktim Dey: I have literally no idea.
10/05/21, 11:01 am - Raktim Dey: What?
10/05/21, 11:01 am - Nafisa: Yes
10/05/21, 11:01 am - Raktim Dey: Abhi bhi incomplete hai?
10/05/21, 11:01 am - Nafisa: Of course
10/05/21, 11:01 am - Nafisa: I'm tired of reminding her
10/05/21, 11:02 am - Raktim Dey: It's ridiculous, I know.
10/05/21, 11:02 am - Raktim Dey: 12:40 ke baad phir se try karo.
10/05/21, 11:03 am - Nafisa: I texted her
10/05/21, 11:03 am - Nafisa: I'm dropping it if she doesn't send one
10/05/21, 11:03 am - Raktim Dey: Okay.
10/05/21, 11:03 am - Nafisa: I have searched for it
10/05/21, 11:04 am - Nafisa: Saw srijan da ka proof also. But she says that not the proof when i asked and she will send one
10/05/21, 11:04 am - Nafisa: Srijan da copied from bazaraa, she says its not the one
10/05/21, 11:04 am - Raktim Dey: If she doesn't send, you have no other option but to leave it.
10/05/21, 11:04 am - Raktim Dey: Achha.
10/05/21, 11:05 am - Nafisa: But net main bhi dekhu toh they give that method only.
10/05/21, 11:05 am - Nafisa: Yes
10/05/21, 11:05 am - Nafisa: So i can't give page nos till then
10/05/21, 11:05 am - Raktim Dey: This is ridiculous. She should have sent it before.
10/05/21, 11:05 am - Nafisa: And its not like i asked her recently
10/05/21, 11:05 am - Nafisa: Its been weeks
10/05/21, 11:06 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know. These people are so irresponsible.
10/05/21, 11:06 am - Nafisa: But she did checked my draft
10/05/21, 11:06 am - Nafisa: I guess they have something going in mind. They are taking it very casually
10/05/21, 11:07 am - Raktim Dey: Agar today last date nahi hota, then it wouldn't seem so bad.
10/05/21, 11:07 am - Nafisa: Hmm

11/05/21, 8:32 pm - Nafisa: Lame random reason

11/05/21, 8:35 pm - Nafisa: Nono.
11/05/21, 8:35 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
11/05/21, 8:35 pm - Raktim Dey: I was joking too.
11/05/21, 8:35 pm - Nafisa: One prank is enough
11/05/21, 8:35 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, he might get suspicious.
11/05/21, 8:35 pm - Nafisa: Yes
11/05/21, 8:35 pm - Nafisa: Then start texting you
11/05/21, 8:35 pm - Nafisa: 🤦‍♀
11/05/21, 8:35 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't have a problem. He won't text me much.
11/05/21, 8:38 pm - Nafisa: But now I feel guilty
11/05/21, 8:38 pm - Nafisa: Ben said we are just having fun
11/05/21, 8:39 pm - Raktim Dey: I guess it probably wasn't the best idea. But now it's over.
11/05/21, 8:39 pm - Raktim Dey: I mean, how will you tell him that you're not dating?
11/05/21, 8:40 pm - Nafisa: It was bad?
11/05/21, 8:40 pm - Raktim Dey: See, if you thought that he didn't like you, then it was fine.
11/05/21, 8:41 pm - Raktim Dey: But if you knew that he did and then told him that, then it was bad.
11/05/21, 8:41 pm - Nafisa: See, i still don't think he likes me.
11/05/21, 8:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Then it's fine.
11/05/21, 8:41 pm - Raktim Dey: But usko bol dena, that it was a prank.
11/05/21, 8:41 pm - Nafisa: Yes
11/05/21, 8:41 pm - Nafisa: Kuch ziada hi lamba keech gaya
11/05/21, 8:42 pm - Nafisa: Btw if i knew and did it. Why would it be bad?
11/05/21, 8:42 pm - Nafisa: It would be.
11/05/21, 8:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Because then it would be really insensitive to do that to someone who just likes you.
11/05/21, 8:42 pm - Raktim Dey: I mean, if I was in his place, I'd feel bad.
11/05/21, 8:48 pm - Nafisa: Yeah
11/05/21, 8:48 pm - Nafisa: I guess even i would
11/05/21, 8:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Wahi.
11/05/21, 8:49 pm - Nafisa: Now i wanna ask him. Debmalya you don't like me na
11/05/21, 8:49 pm - Raktim Dey: No no no.
11/05/21, 8:49 pm - Raktim Dey: That's crazy.
11/05/21, 8:49 pm - Nafisa: Abbe nahi pooch rahi
11/05/21, 8:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
11/05/21, 8:49 pm - Nafisa: You know what makes me think he doesn't like me
11/05/21, 8:50 pm - Raktim Dey: What?
11/05/21, 8:50 pm - Nafisa: Becoz he talks like that to Paulie also. Like asking about love suddenly
11/05/21, 8:50 pm - Nafisa: So yeah

11/05/21, 8:50 pm - Nafisa: Don't
11/05/21, 8:51 pm - Raktim Dey: What?
11/05/21, 8:51 pm - Nafisa: Nothing
11/05/21, 8:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
11/05/21, 8:52 pm - Nafisa: You watched John Wich pura now?
11/05/21, 8:52 pm - Raktim Dey: No. I only saw the first one a few months ago.
11/05/21, 8:53 pm - Nafisa: Watch na pura
11/05/21, 8:54 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay. I'll read the reviews, then download it.
11/05/21, 8:55 pm - Nafisa: Thats means you didn't like it thattt much...
11/05/21, 8:55 pm - Nafisa: I see
11/05/21, 8:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Are, I forgot.😂
11/05/21, 8:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Bohot din pehle dekha tha.
11/05/21, 9:01 pm - Nafisa: Achha
11/05/21, 9:24 pm - Nafisa: Raktim
11/05/21, 9:25 pm - Nafisa: CMI chorke koi college ka form nikla?
11/05/21, 9:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Rkmveri.

11/05/21, 9:28 pm - Nafisa: Nono
11/05/21, 9:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
12/05/21, 11:40 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
12/05/21, 11:40 am - Nafisa: Tintin
12/05/21, 11:40 am - Nafisa: Help with this na
12/05/21, 11:41 am - Raktim Dey: Wait.
12/05/21, 11:43 am - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
12/05/21, 11:48 am - Nafisa: Iska question dikha zara please
12/05/21, 11:49 am - Raktim Dey: It's exactly the same question like yours, just that the subspaces are generated by different vectors.
12/05/21, 11:49 am - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
12/05/21, 11:50 am - Nafisa: Okay
12/05/21, 11:50 am - Nafisa: Thanks
12/05/21, 11:50 am - Nafisa: So these vectors are not the basis and hence we can't decide the dim right?
12/05/21, 11:51 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
12/05/21, 11:52 am - Raktim Dey: They are basis for W1 and W2, but to calculate intersection's dimension, calculate the way it's shown in book.
12/05/21, 11:52 am - Raktim Dey: I didn't get what he meant.
12/05/21, 11:53 am - Nafisa: But they are not linearly independent, so how?
12/05/21, 11:53 am - Raktim Dey: Which aren't linearly independent?
12/05/21, 11:53 am - Nafisa: Vectors of S1 and vectors of S2
12/05/21, 11:54 am - Nafisa: The spanning sets
12/05/21, 11:54 am - Raktim Dey: You checked?
12/05/21, 11:54 am - Nafisa: Yes
12/05/21, 11:54 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah, then he's right. It doesn't matter. It's not a basis.
12/05/21, 11:54 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
12/05/21, 11:54 am - Raktim Dey: But it generates the subspace.
12/05/21, 11:55 am - Nafisa: So if a set of vectors generates a subspace, the no. Of it gives the dim?
12/05/21, 11:55 am - Nafisa: He said Yes
12/05/21, 11:56 am - Nafisa: And now my question is why?
12/05/21, 12:03 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
12/05/21, 12:03 pm - Nafisa: Ty
12/05/21, 12:04 pm - Nafisa: Its not clear. Bohot chota hain.

13/05/21, 9:43 pm - Nafisa: Similar to biryani
13/05/21, 9:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Wow. Sounds great.
13/05/21, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: Its always great
13/05/21, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: Made three types of pakwaan
13/05/21, 9:44 pm - Raktim Dey: I miss beef.
13/05/21, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: Now will put mehendi
13/05/21, 9:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Pakwaan matlab?
13/05/21, 9:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Why?
13/05/21, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: I have stopped liking it like before :(
13/05/21, 9:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh. Kyu?

14/05/21, 6:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Right.
15/05/21, 10:19 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
15/05/21, 12:18 pm - Raktim Dey: Pehle wale ka c and d fixed, whereas b=-a. So dimension is 3, basis me (1 -1 0 0), (0 0 1 0) and (0 0 0 1).
15/05/21, 12:21 pm - Nafisa: Durse main dim=2?
15/05/21, 12:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
15/05/21, 12:25 pm - Nafisa: Why are you writing basis in this way?
15/05/21, 12:26 pm - Nafisa: Should it not be matrix form
15/05/21, 12:26 pm - Raktim Dey: Keyboard se matrix kaise likhu.
15/05/21, 12:26 pm - Nafisa: 2x2 matrix
15/05/21, 12:26 pm - Raktim Dey: I know.
15/05/21, 12:26 pm - Nafisa: Just confirming
15/05/21, 12:26 pm - Nafisa: Ok
15/05/21, 12:26 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
15/05/21, 12:27 pm - Nafisa: Toh dusre ka basis is
15/05/21, 12:27 pm - Raktim Dey: (0100),(0010).
15/05/21, 12:27 pm - Nafisa: a=d=0 toh
15/05/21, 12:28 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
15/05/21, 12:28 pm - Nafisa: Achha haan
15/05/21, 12:28 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
15/05/21, 12:28 pm - Nafisa: Maanle independent hain
15/05/21, 12:28 pm - Raktim Dey: If they are independent, then yes.
15/05/21, 12:28 pm - Nafisa: Haan ok
15/05/21, 12:29 pm - Nafisa: Set of all real 2x2 matrices jab bolte hain then its just
15/05/21, 12:29 pm - Nafisa: This only na
15/05/21, 12:29 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. Just the diagonal is zero.
15/05/21, 12:29 pm - Nafisa: Basis and dim=4
15/05/21, 12:30 pm - Nafisa: Keno?
15/05/21, 12:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Matrix in R² is like R⁴.
15/05/21, 12:30 pm - Raktim Dey: I mean it's isomorphic to R⁴.
15/05/21, 12:32 pm - Nafisa: Haan but why do the diagonal have to be zero?
15/05/21, 12:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Yaha pe a and d zero toh.
15/05/21, 12:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Only in this case.
15/05/21, 12:33 pm - Nafisa: Nana
15/05/21, 12:33 pm - Nafisa: Bolchi when they say find basis of set of 2x2 real matrices
15/05/21, 4:53 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
15/05/21, 4:55 pm - Raktim Dey: aα+bβ me a,b ka value daal ke.
15/05/21, 5:01 pm - Nafisa: Nahi samjhi
15/05/21, 5:08 pm - Raktim Dey: λ=aα+bβ=-b/2(1,2,1)+b(2,1,3).
15/05/21, 5:26 pm - Nafisa: Samaj gayi
15/05/21, 5:26 pm - Nafisa: Thanks
15/05/21, 5:26 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
16/05/21, 8:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Mechanics is so useless.
16/05/21, 8:48 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
16/05/21, 8:48 pm - Raktim Dey: I mean the way DS taught.
16/05/21, 8:48 pm - Raktim Dey: That's much worse.
16/05/21, 8:48 pm - Nafisa: I was just about to send a doubt
16/05/21, 8:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Bhejo.
16/05/21, 8:48 pm - Nafisa: Mechanics is actually very useful
16/05/21, 8:49 pm - Nafisa: But alas!
16/05/21, 8:49 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't have a lot of interest in physics.
16/05/21, 8:49 pm - Nafisa: We got the greatest teachers
16/05/21, 8:49 pm - Raktim Dey: I prefer algebra.
16/05/21, 8:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, true.
16/05/21, 8:49 pm - Nafisa: Same.
16/05/21, 8:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Doubt bhejo.
16/05/21, 8:50 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>

16/05/21, 8:51 pm - Nafisa: Ab bolo bhi
16/05/21, 8:52 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm not sure. Derivation book me nahi hai. I checked.
16/05/21, 8:52 pm - Raktim Dey: I think it comes from Pythagoras theorem somehow.
16/05/21, 8:52 pm - Nafisa: Fuck it
16/05/21, 8:52 pm - Raktim Dey: From the picture in the first page.
16/05/21, 8:53 pm - Raktim Dey: Just remember the formula. That's enough.
16/05/21, 8:53 pm - Nafisa: We havr an imp relation. Thats it
16/05/21, 8:53 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
16/05/21, 8:53 pm - Raktim Dey: You could ask AD if you want.
16/05/21, 8:53 pm - Nafisa: u=1/r kiu?
16/05/21, 8:53 pm - Nafisa: No
16/05/21, 8:53 pm - Nafisa: He don't seem happy when i do that
16/05/21, 8:53 pm - Raktim Dey: We are just defining u that way.
16/05/21, 8:53 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.

16/05/21, 8:56 pm - Nafisa: I felt bad.
16/05/21, 8:56 pm - Raktim Dey: I can go slap him if you want. Mere ghar se 2 minute uska ghar.
16/05/21, 8:56 pm - Nafisa: Nono

20/05/21, 9:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Ha. Exam bhi aa gaya.
20/05/21, 9:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Atleast it's the last one of this college.
20/05/21, 9:41 pm - Nafisa: Sigh

20/05/21, 9:41 pm - Nafisa: Yeap

20/05/21, 9:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Why?
20/05/21, 9:41 pm - Nafisa: They are struggling
20/05/21, 9:41 pm - Nafisa: I have friends
20/05/21, 9:41 pm - Nafisa: They are infected, far from family
20/05/21, 9:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Where are they?
20/05/21, 9:42 pm - Nafisa: It seems like English dept has volunteers too working for COVID
20/05/21, 9:42 pm - Nafisa: Somewhere in quarantine centre
20/05/21, 9:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh. Wow. That is so brave and nice of them.

20/05/21, 9:43 pm - Nafisa: AICUF people
20/05/21, 9:43 pm - Nafisa: And even not from AICUF
20/05/21, 9:43 pm - Nafisa: They have volunteered
20/05/21, 9:43 pm - Raktim Dey: How did they do that?
20/05/21, 9:43 pm - Nafisa: Idk

20/05/21, 9:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I guess.
20/05/21, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: Exam baas postponed na ho
20/05/21, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: My Mom has to go to Kolkata again
20/05/21, 9:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh. Kab?
20/05/21, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: I have to look after my siblings
20/05/21, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: Anytime after lockdown opens here
20/05/21, 9:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Yaha pe bhi toh lockdown hai.

20/05/21, 9:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Exam aur postpone nahi karenge I think.
20/05/21, 9:45 pm - Nafisa: Filal she is okay
20/05/21, 9:45 pm - Nafisa: I hope so
20/05/21, 9:46 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay. That's good.
20/05/21, 9:46 pm - Raktim Dey: Lockdown extend nahi karenge probably, and in any case, sab toh ghar se hi exam denge.
20/05/21, 9:46 pm - Raktim Dey: Questions bhi teachers ke ghar se hi ayega.
20/05/21, 9:46 pm - Nafisa: Nahi wahi problem hain
20/05/21, 9:46 pm - Nafisa: Everyone is not at home
20/05/21, 9:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Students or teachers?
20/05/21, 9:47 pm - Nafisa: Students
20/05/21, 9:47 pm - Nafisa: Teachers ka pata nahi
20/05/21, 9:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Your arts friends?
20/05/21, 9:47 pm - Nafisa: Yeah
20/05/21, 9:48 pm - Raktim Dey: They are doing something really good. What's the point in taking their exam, they seem to have passed the better ones already.
20/05/21, 9:48 pm - Nafisa: I wish their cases are taken good care of
20/05/21, 9:49 pm - Nafisa: Since this is the last shot and sabko hi achhe se likhna hoga na
20/05/21, 9:49 pm - Raktim Dey: College is gonna brag about them for publicity, bolenge their students are doing all this.
20/05/21, 9:49 pm - Nafisa: Kuch bhi kare
20/05/21, 9:49 pm - Nafisa: Unko taqlif na ho baas
20/05/21, 9:50 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, hopefully.
20/05/21, 9:50 pm - Nafisa: They are asking for more days in between if not postponed
20/05/21, 9:50 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh.
20/05/21, 9:50 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't think 10-20 students ke liye pura college ka exams postponed hoga.
20/05/21, 9:50 pm - Nafisa: Haan
20/05/21, 9:51 pm - Nafisa: Wo bhi hain
20/05/21, 9:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
20/05/21, 9:51 pm - Raktim Dey: I hit my knee yesterday, and now I'm not able to walk properly.😂
20/05/21, 10:11 pm - Nafisa: Aiyyooo
20/05/21, 10:11 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
20/05/21, 10:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
20/05/21, 10:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Plus I went to teach, walk up stairs, and it's worse now.
20/05/21, 10:22 pm - Nafisa: Itni zor se lag gayi
20/05/21, 10:23 pm - Nafisa: Apply volini ,aaram milega
20/05/21, 10:26 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
21/05/21, 1:32 pm - Nafisa: Did you solve laplace equation?
21/05/21, 1:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Complex analysis?
21/05/21, 1:33 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
21/05/21, 1:33 pm - Raktim Dey: Page no?
21/05/21, 1:33 pm - Nafisa: Nahi nahi
21/05/21, 1:33 pm - Nafisa: 255
21/05/21, 1:33 pm - Nafisa: I solved it on my own too.
21/05/21, 1:33 pm - Nafisa: Its not matching
21/05/21, 1:34 pm - Nafisa: Nor with sir. Waise bhi sir ne bohot galat kiya hain
21/05/21, 1:34 pm - Nafisa: Also*
21/05/21, 1:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know.
21/05/21, 1:34 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
21/05/21, 1:34 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
21/05/21, 1:34 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
21/05/21, 1:35 pm - Nafisa: For lamda =0
21/05/21, 1:35 pm - Raktim Dey: Solution exists only for lambda<0.
21/05/21, 1:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Yaha pe Y=E sinh α(y+F) hai. F=-b hai. So wo put kite hai. And they wrote the first term outside the summation here.
21/05/21, 2:02 pm - Nafisa: Achha sunno na
21/05/21, 2:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Bolo.
21/05/21, 2:02 pm - Nafisa: But see na for lamda =0 i'm getting a solution
21/05/21, 2:02 pm - Nafisa: Check na what wrong i did
21/05/21, 2:03 pm - Nafisa: Boundary conditions i took as text not sir
21/05/21, 2:03 pm - Nafisa: kite matlab?
21/05/21, 2:03 pm - Raktim Dey: Kiye*
21/05/21, 2:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Two boundary conditions are there. X(0)=X'(0)=0.
21/05/21, 2:05 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
21/05/21, 2:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Even if it so, then you are getting X=c. That's a trivial solution toh. You're not getting anything in terms of 'x'. So we didn't take it .
21/05/21, 2:07 pm - Nafisa: Achha
21/05/21, 2:07 pm - Nafisa: Constant is taken as trivial only na
21/05/21, 2:08 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
21/05/21, 2:08 pm - Nafisa: Ye nahi samjhi. Maybe at night i will do again and send you okay
21/05/21, 2:08 pm - Nafisa: Will you check my answer pura? Its about 5 pages
21/05/21, 2:09 pm - Raktim Dey: Dekho, instead of the summation going from 0 to infinity, they took it from 1 to infinity, and they took the 0th term outside.
21/05/21, 2:09 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
21/05/21, 2:09 pm - Nafisa: Why is it from 0
21/05/21, 2:09 pm - Nafisa: Phele toh sab 1 se liye the
21/05/21, 2:09 pm - Nafisa: Like the other sums
21/05/21, 2:10 pm - Raktim Dey: Fourier series me 0 wala bahar lete hai, the a0 one.
21/05/21, 2:10 pm - Nafisa: Other times its always 0?
21/05/21, 2:11 pm - Nafisa: Heat equation and vibration string
21/05/21, 2:11 pm - Raktim Dey: It's always from 0 only. We write from 1 because we take a0 outside in the Fourier series definition.
21/05/21, 2:11 pm - Nafisa: Okay
21/05/21, 2:11 pm - Nafisa: Wahi main pooch rahi thi
21/05/21, 2:11 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.

26/05/21, 10:59 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay. Then that's your decision. You shouldn't do anything that makes you uncomfortable.

27/05/21, 12:01 am - Nafisa: (Teri aankhon se hui thi
 pehli mulakat,
sawale se shuru hui thi
hamari baat.
Teri aane ki humko 
ek baat na thi koi soch,
tere jaane se phir hone laga
aapsos.)(2)
Phir se un dino ko hum jeena chahein,
phir se teri sawalo ko sehna chahein-
Yeh meri guzarish hein
guzarish hein
guzarish hein
meri yeh guzarish hein.

(Un galliyon kinare hoti thi baat,
aab nehi raha un raato ka saath.
Baarish se na thi humko yaari,
tere aane ke baad ho geya zaroori.)(2)
Aab un sabko chor ke hum door,
khawbo mein Peeta Hu tere chehra ka noor.
Gaam nehi hein tum se na milneki,
samey ne na ki kabhi humse dosti.(2)
Phir se un dino ko hum jeena chahein,
phir se teri sawalo ko sehna chahein-
Yeh meri guzarish hein
guzarish hein
guzarish hein
meri yeh guzarish hein.

(Tumse na thi pyar shuruaat mein,
aab rehti ho mere dil ke ghar mein.
Kabhi na ki teri intezaar,
lekin un lamho ko hum bhul na saake yaar.)(2)
(Chahein tum kisi aur se pyar karo, chahein tum mujhse nakkhrat karo,)(2)
lekin tumko hum khush dekhna chahein,
tumko sirf khush dekhna chahein-
Yeh meri guzarish hein
guzarish hein
guzarish hein
meri yeh guzarish hein.

Phir se un dino ko hum jeena chahein,
phir se teri sawalo ko sehna chahein-
Yeh meri guzarish hein
guzarish hein
guzarish hein
meri yeh guzarish hein.

27/05/21, 12:06 am - Nafisa: Becoz I felt as if he is trapped
27/05/21, 12:06 am - Nafisa: Whores are not bad.
27/05/21, 12:07 am - Raktim Dey: Of course not. But I think by whore, he means just someone who he wants to sleep with and can't really make an actual connection with.
27/05/21, 12:07 am - Nafisa: Yeah

05/06/21, 10:00 pm - Nafisa: Yehee
05/06/21, 10:00 pm - Raktim Dey: I didn't keep track of time before.😂
05/06/21, 10:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Plus didn't have to study, so.
05/06/21, 10:01 pm - Nafisa: Yah, take a break
05/06/21, 10:02 pm - Raktim Dey: I will. For a week or so.
05/06/21, 10:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Read a book.
05/06/21, 10:04 pm - Nafisa: Eeee
05/06/21, 10:05 pm - Nafisa: I will call again some other day. I had a very bad mood after exam. Tumse baat karke achha laga

05/06/21, 10:06 pm - Nafisa: Sourajyoti ka jatka dege I felt better
05/06/21, 10:06 pm - Raktim Dey: It was quite a jhatka.
05/06/21, 10:06 pm - Nafisa: Mereko khud bhi laga, i called him innocent 🤦‍♀️
05/06/21, 10:06 pm - Nafisa: Poor kid. Now think of Sej
05/06/21, 10:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, well you never really know a person.
05/06/21, 10:07 pm - Nafisa: Yeah. I'm learning that
05/06/21, 10:07 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
05/06/21, 10:07 pm - Nafisa: My class is bunch of idiots and self -centered people
05/06/21, 10:07 pm - Raktim Dey: You realised this today?
05/06/21, 10:07 pm - Nafisa: Hypocrites saale sab
05/06/21, 10:07 pm - Raktim Dey: Obviously.😂
05/06/21, 10:08 pm - Nafisa: I thought there were few who were nice. But no, during exams and today after hearing about Sourajyoti
05/06/21, 10:08 pm - Nafisa: Because I never call anyone innocent except for Sej
05/06/21, 10:09 pm - Nafisa: But Sourajyoti ko mene bohot look up kiya tha. I also told him I will be proud if one day he succeeds in his life to a high level
05/06/21, 10:10 pm - Nafisa: I was about to fight for him with Debmalya
05/06/21, 10:11 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, me too. I didn't really think that he'd like and act like he's different when he's not. What's the point. Almost everyone is cheating. Why act like you're better.
05/06/21, 10:12 pm - Nafisa: You don't become any  low if you cheat, your knowledge stays where it is. (My opinion )
05/06/21, 10:13 pm - Nafisa: You may not agree and thats okay
05/06/21, 10:14 pm - Raktim Dey: Look, cheating is different. But lying about cheating is something else.😂
05/06/21, 10:14 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣🤣
05/06/21, 10:14 pm - Nafisa: Sourajyoti doesn't know or assumes we are not good enough friends to find out about his hypocrisy
05/06/21, 10:15 pm - Raktim Dey: He thinks I don't cheat so I don't talking about that with anyone.
05/06/21, 10:16 pm - Nafisa: Haha
05/06/21, 10:16 pm - Nafisa: He forgot you got talkative friends like me and Sej
05/06/21, 10:17 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
05/06/21, 10:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, maybe.😂
05/06/21, 10:17 pm - Nafisa: I still wonder what made Sujayan ask you
05/06/21, 10:17 pm - Nafisa: Matlab bhai
05/06/21, 10:17 pm - Nafisa: Itna himmat
05/06/21, 10:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Sourajyoti is telling me his exam wasn't very good. AD ka part was tough, DS ka lengthy.

19/06/21, 9:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Bolo.
19/06/21, 9:40 pm - Nafisa: What is the difference between vector line integral and scalar line integral
19/06/21, 9:40 pm - Nafisa: Because formula different hain
19/06/21, 9:41 pm - Raktim Dey: If F is a scalar function, then the integral is called scalar integral. And you usually calculate |F'(t)|dt.
If F is vector, you integrate F.dr=(Fx,Fy,Fz).(dx,dy,dz). This is vector line integral.
19/06/21, 9:45 pm - Nafisa: Ok
19/06/21, 9:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Did you understand?

23/06/21, 9:41 pm - Nafisa: Aese hi
23/06/21, 9:41 pm - Nafisa: My brain says NO
23/06/21, 9:42 pm - Raktim Dey: You think she's earning a lot of money?
23/06/21, 9:42 pm - Nafisa: No
23/06/21, 9:42 pm - Nafisa: Idk its more of indifferent
23/06/21, 9:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Do you know what a pyramid scheme is?
23/06/21, 9:42 pm - Nafisa: Like I don't care what she does but I have problem when she shows off

23/06/21, 9:43 pm - Nafisa: Jk😂 tell
23/06/21, 9:43 pm - Raktim Dey: It's actually a fraud business, where a company asks you to pay some money first, then they tell you that you'll get commission if you recruit more people, and then they tell the same to them.
23/06/21, 9:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Ultimately not many people earn money. Only the company gets the money from people when they ask you to join.
23/06/21, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: So she is falling for it?
23/06/21, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: Nice.
23/06/21, 9:45 pm - Raktim Dey: What do you think are the chances of 10 pass students earning 50k a month during a pandemic and such massive unemployment?

23/06/21, 9:46 pm - Nafisa: Shit, this is bad. I feel bad for him
23/06/21, 9:46 pm - Raktim Dey: They took 16k for the job, then they paid him 2500 at first from his own money, so he thought it was genuine. Uske baad khatam.
23/06/21, 9:46 pm - Raktim Dey: You shouldn't. It was plain greed and sheer stupidity.
23/06/21, 9:46 pm - Nafisa: My uncle went through this.
23/06/21, 9:46 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
23/06/21, 9:46 pm - Nafisa: Well. Well

23/06/21, 9:48 pm - Nafisa: Every kid thinks that after he explains something to his elder siblings
23/06/21, 9:48 pm - Raktim Dey: And besides, the only 10 pass who earn 50-70k a month are politicians, criminals and soldiers.
23/06/21, 9:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Younger you mean.😂
23/06/21, 9:48 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣joke of my life
23/06/21, 9:48 pm - Nafisa: Nope, no typo

23/06/21, 9:50 pm - Nafisa: I'm sure you can manipulate me every easily
23/06/21, 9:50 pm - Nafisa: Do you remember the cream on black board thing?
23/06/21, 9:50 pm - Raktim Dey: I can try.

23/06/21, 9:51 pm - Nafisa: My only cream for my face
23/06/21, 9:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh.😂
23/06/21, 9:51 pm - Nafisa: O hello?

23/06/21, 9:57 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.😂
23/06/21, 9:57 pm - Nafisa: OMG
23/06/21, 9:58 pm - Nafisa: I ignored that thing completely because i'm so fascinated by his killing ideas
23/06/21, 9:58 pm - Nafisa: Actually that room.
23/06/21, 9:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Then you should watch Hannibal.
23/06/21, 9:58 pm - Nafisa: Okieee
23/06/21, 9:59 pm - Nafisa: Psycho  movie yaad hain, that movie was scary for me
23/06/21, 9:59 pm - Nafisa: The ending scene

23/06/21, 10:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
23/06/21, 10:17 pm - Nafisa: How to activate Windows?
23/06/21, 10:18 pm - Raktim Dey: You have pirated windows?
23/06/21, 10:18 pm - Nafisa: No conquered it
23/06/21, 10:18 pm - Nafisa: I got a free door
23/06/21, 10:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Not funny.
23/06/21, 10:19 pm - Nafisa: It wasn't for a laugh
23/06/21, 10:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Is "activate windows" written on your screen?
23/06/21, 10:20 pm - Nafisa: '' Come for sex '' should be there instead?
23/06/21, 10:20 pm - Raktim Dey: That's not bad.
23/06/21, 10:20 pm - Raktim Dey: You can't activate windows if it's pirated.
23/06/21, 10:21 pm - Nafisa: What is that now?
23/06/21, 10:21 pm - Nafisa: Mereko apna background change karna hain and its not allowing, asking to activate windows
23/06/21, 10:22 pm - Raktim Dey: You need a key to activate Windows. You get that key when you buy Windows for 5000.
23/06/21, 10:22 pm - Nafisa: Buy me one then :)
23/06/21, 10:22 pm - Raktim Dey: If you want to change background, download some picture, right click on it, and click on set as desktop background.
23/06/21, 10:23 pm - Nafisa: Fine
23/06/21, 10:23 pm - Nafisa: .
23/06/21, 10:23 pm - Nafisa: Say something sarcastic now. Yes
23/06/21, 10:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Wait. Let me ask Tanu to give recruit me. Uska paisa milne ke baad.
23/06/21, 10:23 pm - Nafisa: There it is
23/06/21, 10:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Obviously.
23/06/21, 10:24 pm - Nafisa: This is so funny
23/06/21, 10:24 pm - Nafisa: Tanu
23/06/21, 10:24 pm - Nafisa: Debmalya, Tanu, Mihir, etc are a joke to me
23/06/21, 10:24 pm - Nafisa: Unka naam sunte hi I laugh
23/06/21, 10:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I understand.😂
23/06/21, 10:24 pm - Nafisa: Yo

23/06/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: Last*
23/06/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
23/06/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: You are gonna get Nafisa version of this sticker. :)
23/06/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: Bye
23/06/21, 10:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Why?😂
24/06/21, 1:01 am - Nafisa: Aese hi
24/06/21, 1:01 am - Raktim Dey: Okay.
24/06/21, 1:31 pm - Nafisa: Did you do clairaut form ,singular solutions?
24/06/21, 1:31 pm - Nafisa: Solving non exact equations and non homogeneous solutions?
24/06/21, 1:32 pm - Nafisa: Did you do all these?
24/06/21, 1:33 pm - Raktim Dey: For DU?
24/06/21, 1:33 pm - Nafisa: For anything
24/06/21, 1:33 pm - Nafisa: No DU and all
24/06/21, 1:33 pm - Nafisa: Just in general for entrance
24/06/21, 1:34 pm - Raktim Dey: I didn't do the p q ones. But rest I did. Clairaut's form isn't there in syllabus.
24/06/21, 1:34 pm - Nafisa: Ok
24/06/21, 1:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Partial differential equations, the ones from sem 3, wo karna.
24/06/21, 1:34 pm - Nafisa: Same p and q ones solvable by y and x
24/06/21, 1:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Auxiliary equations waale.
24/06/21, 1:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
24/06/21, 1:34 pm - Nafisa: Konse?
24/06/21, 1:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Book me hai. Partial differential equations.
24/06/21, 1:35 pm - Nafisa: See i don't have notes so i can't look back
24/06/21, 1:35 pm - Raktim Dey: Hyderabad ka questions are very difficult.
24/06/21, 1:35 pm - Raktim Dey: dx/P=dy/Q=dz/R waale.
24/06/21, 1:35 pm - Nafisa: Konse book main hain?
24/06/21, 1:36 pm - Raktim Dey: Maity Ghosh. Shayad Tyn Myint me bhi hai.
24/06/21, 1:36 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
24/06/21, 1:37 pm - Raktim Dey: Chapter 2.
24/06/21, 1:37 pm - Nafisa: Are you sure?
24/06/21, 1:37 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
24/06/21, 1:37 pm - Nafisa: That was never in our syllabus
24/06/21, 1:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Just process dekh lena. Sums are easy, you don't need to do them.
24/06/21, 1:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Sem 3 me tha.
24/06/21, 1:38 pm - Nafisa: DS ka part?
24/06/21, 1:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Lagrange's method.
24/06/21, 1:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
24/06/21, 1:38 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
24/06/21, 1:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
24/06/21, 1:39 pm - Nafisa: This is not partial differentiation
24/06/21, 1:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh. Sorry.
24/06/21, 1:39 pm - Raktim Dey: But ha, ye dekh lena.
24/06/21, 1:39 pm - Nafisa: Dekha
24/06/21, 1:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Try orthogonal trajectories.
24/06/21, 1:39 pm - Nafisa: Jamia main bhi tha
24/06/21, 1:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
24/06/21, 1:39 pm - Nafisa: Yes
24/06/21, 1:40 pm - Nafisa: Ye bhi? I don't remember studying this
24/06/21, 1:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Forget it. Galti se bola.
24/06/21, 1:40 pm - Nafisa: Achha
24/06/21, 1:40 pm - Nafisa: Thanks re
24/06/21, 1:41 pm - Raktim Dey: No problem.
24/06/21, 1:41 pm - Nafisa: Differential is vast
24/06/21, 1:41 pm - Nafisa: My lord
24/06/21, 1:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. It's too much.
24/06/21, 1:41 pm - Nafisa: Exactly
24/06/21, 1:41 pm - Nafisa: And you can't skip
24/06/21, 1:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Ha. Saare entrances me hai.
24/06/21, 1:41 pm - Nafisa: Because you don't know what they will give to solve
24/06/21, 1:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
24/06/21, 1:42 pm - Nafisa: Yeap, mereko ab takbek type ka questions karne nahi aaya
24/06/21, 1:42 pm - Nafisa: I will send you tonight
24/06/21, 1:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
24/06/21, 1:42 pm - Nafisa: Abhi i need rest
24/06/21, 1:42 pm - Raktim Dey: You were studying?
24/06/21, 1:44 pm - Nafisa: Yes
24/06/21, 1:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
24/06/21, 9:26 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
24/06/21, 9:27 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
24/06/21, 9:50 pm - Raktim Dey: This is Cauchy Euler toh. Put x =e^t.
24/06/21, 9:55 pm - Raktim Dey: You deleted this message
24/06/21, 10:12 pm - Nafisa: Ok
24/06/21, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: This one I tried, but I couldn't get the right answer.
24/06/21, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Ye Jamia ka hai?
24/06/21, 10:52 pm - Nafisa: No
24/06/21, 10:52 pm - Nafisa: What method you used? Can you show
24/06/21, 10:53 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
24/06/21, 10:57 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
24/06/21, 10:58 pm - Raktim Dey: I differentiated cot y/x instead of integrating it. That's so stupid.
24/06/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
24/06/21, 10:58 pm - Raktim Dey: This question is wrong. There will be a dx with the first term as well.
24/06/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: Haan
24/06/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: Ye integration sahi hain dekho? Agar haan toh explain na
24/06/21, 10:59 pm - Raktim Dey: You can do it my way after correcting the question.
24/06/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: Abbe gaandu
24/06/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: I corrected the question
24/06/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: Wo integration samaj nahi aaya
24/06/21, 11:01 pm - Raktim Dey: If you differentiate log sin y/x, you'll get that expression. There's no actual process. You have to recognise it by seeing the integral.
24/06/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: Lord
24/06/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: Not that part
24/06/21, 11:01 pm - Raktim Dey: Phir?
24/06/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: There is one 1/x before it
24/06/21, 11:02 pm - Raktim Dey: dx/x gives log x.
24/06/21, 11:02 pm - Nafisa: How did that vanish?
24/06/21, 11:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Wo toh hai.
24/06/21, 11:02 pm - Nafisa: Leave it
24/06/21, 11:02 pm - Raktim Dey: What?
24/06/21, 11:03 pm - Raktim Dey: In integration of N dy, x is taken as a constant. So when you are integrating it, you're doing wrt dy, so x is constant.
24/06/21, 11:04 pm - Raktim Dey: d/dx(log sin y/x) =cot y/x * 1/x.
24/06/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
24/06/21, 11:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Here you are integrating wrt x, so y is constant. d/dx(log sin y/x)= cot y/x *d/dx(y/x), which is -y/x².
24/06/21, 11:06 pm - Nafisa: Okay
24/06/21, 11:06 pm - Nafisa: Thanks
24/06/21, 11:07 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
24/06/21, 11:07 pm - Nafisa: Do you remember this?
24/06/21, 11:08 pm - Raktim Dey: Not very well. I'll need some time to solve these.
24/06/21, 11:08 pm - Raktim Dey: Chapter 5 me hai ye sab.
24/06/21, 11:08 pm - Nafisa: Pata hain
24/06/21, 11:09 pm - Nafisa: I know the method, but these three particular i couldn't
24/06/21, 11:09 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay. I'll try.
24/06/21, 11:09 pm - Nafisa: Ok
24/06/21, 11:31 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
24/06/21, 11:33 pm - Nafisa: Genius
24/06/21, 11:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Nope.
24/06/21, 11:34 pm - Nafisa: The second one is same na? 2 can be broken down to 1+2
24/06/21, 11:34 pm - Nafisa: 1+1*
24/06/21, 11:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
24/06/21, 11:35 pm - Nafisa: I will try the others, 3rd one ka idea dona
24/06/21, 11:36 pm - Raktim Dey: Just factorise the expression. Uske baad easy, direct formula hai book me.
24/06/21, 11:37 pm - Nafisa: Ok i will try
24/06/21, 11:37 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
25/06/21, 10:47 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
25/06/21, 10:47 am - Nafisa: Did you solve this paper?
25/06/21, 10:51 am - Nafisa: And what is the difference between PUBDET and PUMDET?
25/06/21, 10:51 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
25/06/21, 12:19 pm - Raktim Dey: B stands for Bachelor's, M stands for Master's.
25/06/21, 12:19 pm - Nafisa: Oh
25/06/21, 12:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
27/06/21, 12:40 am - Raktim Dey: I just wanted to say that whatever I posted that day, I did because I was upset that Minerva didn't pass in complex analysis and everyone else did. And then Ritika and Sourajyoti started posting about graduating, so. I should have hid the status from you and Sejuti as well, because it wasn't meant for you.
27/06/21, 7:37 am - Nafisa: This message was deleted
27/06/21, 7:42 am - Nafisa: This message was deleted
27/06/21, 8:12 am - Nafisa: How do you BJP won 2019 election fairly😂
27/06/21, 8:12 am - Nafisa: I'm okay only, just talk to Sej, she was hurt.
27/06/21, 12:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
27/06/21, 12:40 pm - Raktim Dey: I texted her as well.
27/06/21, 1:12 pm - Nafisa: Good
27/06/21, 1:13 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm becoming a loud mouth. Jo dimag me ata hai bol de raha hu.
27/06/21, 3:41 pm - Nafisa: I'm sorry, I had a busy day, maid didn't come so had to help Mom
27/06/21, 3:41 pm - Nafisa: Its good to be loud but also be sensible. And you will learn hopefully.
27/06/21, 3:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
27/06/21, 3:49 pm - Nafisa: Raktim, I'm not angry with you. I'm really not.
27/06/21, 3:50 pm - Nafisa: So don't worry about it. I genuinely had a busy day
27/06/21, 3:50 pm - Raktim Dey: No no, it's not that.
27/06/21, 3:50 pm - Raktim Dey: Sejuti is ignoring my message.
27/06/21, 3:50 pm - Raktim Dey: Messages*
27/06/21, 3:50 pm - Nafisa: I told you
27/06/21, 3:50 pm - Nafisa: She is hurt
27/06/21, 3:51 pm - Raktim Dey: But the post wasn't meant for her. Or you either. I just didn't like the fact that some of them posted about graduating.
27/06/21, 3:51 pm - Nafisa: See, tbh i knew that was coming, because ye leke phele bhi ho chuka hain. But she was hurt and your status made her day worse
27/06/21, 3:52 pm - Nafisa: The way you didn't like people posting something, we also didn't like what you posted
27/06/21, 3:52 pm - Nafisa: We forwarded documents
27/06/21, 3:52 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. I should have hid the post from you and Sejuti as well.
27/06/21, 3:53 pm - Nafisa: I knew it wasn't for us, but you should have given it a thought what if it affects us
27/06/21, 3:53 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I should have. That's my fault. I know.
27/06/21, 3:53 pm - Nafisa: And hiding it from us won't make a difference
27/06/21, 3:54 pm - Nafisa: Because the point you picked up we were there
27/06/21, 3:54 pm - Raktim Dey: No, but then you'd know that I wasn't talking about you.
27/06/21, 3:54 pm - Nafisa: Bro, i know it wasn't for us and I also knew it was for Sourajoyoti
27/06/21, 3:54 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
27/06/21, 3:54 pm - Nafisa: But think of few of them
27/06/21, 3:55 pm - Raktim Dey: I didn't care about my marks, honestly. I just wanted to pass and I did.
27/06/21, 3:55 pm - Nafisa: Like Paulie, Ben, did you want to spoil their day too?
27/06/21, 3:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
27/06/21, 3:55 pm - Nafisa: I know, it was all because of Minerva
27/06/21, 3:55 pm - Nafisa: Yes? You wanted to?
27/06/21, 3:55 pm - Raktim Dey: She doesn't know by the way.
27/06/21, 3:56 pm - Nafisa: Well if you wanted that, remember they are my close friends and anyone doing or even thinking about it i will break their face
27/06/21, 3:56 pm - Raktim Dey: Anyone who were doing happy posts about graduating, yeah.
27/06/21, 3:56 pm - Nafisa: Wtf
27/06/21, 3:56 pm - Nafisa: Raktin
27/06/21, 3:56 pm - Nafisa: Get it in your head
27/06/21, 3:57 pm - Nafisa: Ben and Paul were upset about Minerva genuinely ok
27/06/21, 3:57 pm - Nafisa: And you posting that didn't make mg feel great, well as you told she didn't even realise it was for her
27/06/21, 3:57 pm - Raktim Dey: Minerva didn't see the post. I hid it from her.
27/06/21, 3:57 pm - Nafisa: You should learn one thing, what you think Don't always necessarily be right.
27/06/21, 3:58 pm - Nafisa: Very good.
27/06/21, 3:59 pm - Nafisa: You made a joke out of yourself for your information. It was so childish, people were laughing thinking you were angry about everyone passing. So your point got all wrong and jiske liye status tha usiko farak nahi padha
27/06/21, 3:59 pm - Nafisa: Rather it hurt one of your friends
27/06/21, 3:59 pm - Nafisa: And dissapointed the other
27/06/21, 4:00 pm - Raktim Dey: So I'm supposed to feel bad about the fact that because of everyone cheating, TB set such a difficult paper that I worked so hard and got 57 out of 100 and Minerva failed, right?
27/06/21, 4:00 pm - Raktim Dey: And my GPA went below 7.
27/06/21, 4:01 pm - Nafisa: Look at the hypocrisy
27/06/21, 4:01 pm - Nafisa: You said you didn't cared about marks
27/06/21, 4:01 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't. I said that to make a point.
27/06/21, 4:01 pm - Nafisa: And we all cheated to pass becoz we didn't want to ruin our future because of some sadist professors
27/06/21, 4:02 pm - Nafisa: Your point is very pointy
27/06/21, 4:02 pm - Nafisa: So actually you weren't even sorry for what you did
27/06/21, 4:02 pm - Nafisa: Great
27/06/21, 4:02 pm - Raktim Dey: I was sorry that I hurt you and Sejuti. I'm not sorry for posting.
27/06/21, 4:02 pm - Raktim Dey: I even mailed TB.
27/06/21, 4:03 pm - Nafisa: What did u mail? Sir make everyone fail
27/06/21, 4:03 pm - Raktim Dey: I pissed him too I guess, because he didn't mail back.
27/06/21, 4:03 pm - Raktim Dey: Of course not.
27/06/21, 4:04 pm - Nafisa: You know what
27/06/21, 4:04 pm - Nafisa: You are immature
27/06/21, 4:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
27/06/21, 4:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Anything else?
27/06/21, 4:08 pm - Raktim Dey: Well?
27/06/21, 5:04 pm - Nafisa: Yes Dumbbo
27/06/21, 5:04 pm - Nafisa: I'm here again
27/06/21, 5:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
27/06/21, 5:05 pm - Nafisa: Had to charge up. You need to learn few things and you know it I guess. Not everytime I will come back. You can talk to me if something sometimes bother you.
27/06/21, 5:06 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't care anymore about that. I just feel bad that I hurt you and Sejuti.
27/06/21, 5:06 pm - Nafisa: About what? Tell me
27/06/21, 5:07 pm - Nafisa: Thats the first step you have to go through
27/06/21, 5:07 pm - Nafisa: Otherwise things may repeat
27/06/21, 5:10 pm - Raktim Dey: I felt bad about Minerva. But that's not all. I mean, it's not that I feel bad I got 57. I consider it good marks as far as the paper went. Thing is, this became a little too much, because even in my school, everyone used to take tuitions from school teachers and got more marks because they were paying them, and I got less because I wasn't. But in the end, I did better than most in ISC. So anyway, I just didn't like the fact that my cgpa went down and some students will get more than me even without studying. So that pissed me off.
But I don't care about it anymore. I'll just keep saying sorry to you and Sejuti till you feel angry with me.
27/06/21, 5:11 pm - Raktim Dey: And please don't anyone that I mailed TB.
27/06/21, 5:13 pm - Raktim Dey: Tell*
27/06/21, 5:13 pm - Nafisa: What did you mail him about?
27/06/21, 5:14 pm - Raktim Dey: That he made the paper too difficult because of which Minerva failed. He didn't reply, just forwarded it to SR.
27/06/21, 5:14 pm - Nafisa: You could start up tell me this, now I understand the whole point of the status, but Raktim believe me nobody remember marks its the long term consistency which matters and you are a brilliant student and thats what everyone is gonna remember.
27/06/21, 5:15 pm - Raktim Dey: I wouldn't care about it either, but IISER me CGPA matters. They give you interview based on that.
27/06/21, 5:15 pm - Nafisa: You shouldn't have done that, he is gonna set her supplementary paper.
27/06/21, 5:16 pm - Raktim Dey: SR called me after that. Then she took Minerva's number and told her that they might set the supplementary paper sooner. So atleast something good came out of it.
27/06/21, 5:16 pm - Raktim Dey: She might not have to wait a year.
27/06/21, 5:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Anyway, nothing is confirmed yet.
27/06/21, 5:18 pm - Nafisa: She was not gonna wait
27/06/21, 5:18 pm - Nafisa: Supplementary tha phele se hi
27/06/21, 5:19 pm - Nafisa: And it will happen soon. Raktim don't take challenges with people who can make you feel helpless during a fight
27/06/21, 5:19 pm - Nafisa: What if TB sets a tuff question paper? Whenever you feel like doing something big have a talk with someone, it helps
27/06/21, 5:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
27/06/21, 5:20 pm - Nafisa: I know you are feeling bad when I sad this
27/06/21, 5:20 pm - Raktim Dey: I'll call TB and apologize.
27/06/21, 5:21 pm - Nafisa: Yes maybe he will not even pick up
27/06/21, 5:21 pm - Nafisa: Send me the mail, maybe its not that serious
27/06/21, 5:21 pm - Raktim Dey: I'll atleast try.
27/06/21, 5:21 pm - Nafisa: Was it an angry mail or sir we are doom mail
27/06/21, 5:21 pm - Nafisa: Wait wait
27/06/21, 5:21 pm - Nafisa: First let me read the mail
27/06/21, 5:21 pm - Nafisa: Lets not complicate things more
27/06/21, 5:22 pm - Raktim Dey: It was an angry mail, but it wasn't disrespectful.
27/06/21, 5:22 pm - Nafisa: Show me
27/06/21, 5:22 pm - Nafisa: Please
27/06/21, 5:22 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
27/06/21, 5:24 pm - Nafisa: What did SR say?
27/06/21, 5:24 pm - Raktim Dey: SR was asking me if I am okay and all that. I don't think they were angry.
27/06/21, 5:24 pm - Raktim Dey: They thought I still was.
27/06/21, 5:24 pm - Nafisa: Okay then good
27/06/21, 5:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
27/06/21, 5:25 pm - Nafisa: SR is a good woman
27/06/21, 5:25 pm - Nafisa: And TB also is good human
27/06/21, 5:25 pm - Raktim Dey: I'll call TB anyway.
27/06/21, 5:25 pm - Nafisa: But since this is for MG call Tb
27/06/21, 5:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
27/06/21, 5:25 pm - Nafisa: Very gentle ok
27/06/21, 5:25 pm - Nafisa: Whatever he says you say yes and even cry
27/06/21, 5:26 pm - Nafisa: Fake crying ka bhi zarurat pade karlo
27/06/21, 5:26 pm - Nafisa: But make sure you keep the call satisfying him that he is great so that he doesn't take his anger out on Mg ka paper
27/06/21, 5:27 pm - Nafisa: He Will for sure ask you what took you one dat to realize bolna self reflection
27/06/21, 5:27 pm - Nafisa: And Mg ko breakdown hua and all. Make sure you do emotional blackmail
27/06/21, 5:32 pm - Raktim Dey: I called him.
27/06/21, 5:33 pm - Raktim Dey: It's all sorted out.
27/06/21, 5:33 pm - Nafisa: What did he say?
27/06/21, 5:33 pm - Raktim Dey: I told him what I had to. It's fine now. I don't think he'll make questions intentionally tough for Minerva.
27/06/21, 5:34 pm - Nafisa: I told him what I had to
27/06/21, 5:34 pm - Nafisa: Barah aya sherlock holmes

05/07/21, 8:03 pm - Nafisa: Why are colleges so unsure
05/07/21, 8:03 pm - Raktim Dey: Depends on Covid cases.

05/07/21, 9:06 pm - Nafisa: Haan toh bolti, Theek hain bhaiyaji, kuch aur pata chale toh apni behen ko batana.
05/07/21, 9:06 pm - Nafisa: My net sucks
05/07/21, 9:06 pm - Nafisa: Ttyl
05/07/21, 9:07 pm - Raktim Dey: That would have felt cringy.
05/07/21, 9:09 pm - Nafisa: Yeah. Thats why it shared here and not anywhere else
05/07/21, 9:10 pm - Nafisa: Chiii, now I'm reading it and my eyes wanna bleed
05/07/21, 9:10 pm - Raktim Dey: Exactly.😂
05/07/21, 9:31 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
05/07/21, 9:34 pm - Nafisa: Ahahaha
05/07/21, 9:35 pm - Nafisa: My sister said you have beautiful hands
05/07/21, 9:36 pm - Raktim Dey: Tell her thanks.😂
05/07/21, 9:36 pm - Nafisa: This message was deleted
05/07/21, 9:36 pm - Raktim Dey: What?
05/07/21, 9:36 pm - Nafisa: Okay
05/07/21, 9:36 pm - Nafisa: Dara
05/07/21, 9:36 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
05/07/21, 9:37 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes. It's from Mean Value theorem.
05/07/21, 9:37 pm - Raktim Dey: It has to be integrable. That's all.
05/07/21, 9:37 pm - Nafisa: Now this stupid mean value theorem doesn't get in my head
05/07/21, 9:38 pm - Nafisa: The other sum that day also I didn't understand which you told by Mean value theorem
05/07/21, 9:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Did you read the theorem?
05/07/21, 9:38 pm - Raktim Dey: The definition.
05/07/21, 9:38 pm - Nafisa: Yes
05/07/21, 9:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay. You just need to remember the statement. Proof is complicated.
05/07/21, 9:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Kya samajh nahi aya?
05/07/21, 9:39 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
05/07/21, 9:39 pm - Nafisa: I understood the statement but couldn't use it
05/07/21, 9:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Write f(c) instead of xi.
05/07/21, 9:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Integration of fg=f(c) × integration of g.
05/07/21, 9:40 pm - Nafisa: Ok i will try again
05/07/21, 9:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Book me dekhna, likha hai ye. This holds if is continuous on [a,b]. We use this statement in general.
05/07/21, 11:31 pm - Nafisa: Now When I'm solving this, the whole square part I can't do only
05/07/21, 11:32 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
05/07/21, 11:32 pm - Raktim Dey: x²+kx=x²+2*x*k/2+(k/2)²-(k/2)².
05/07/21, 11:33 pm - Raktim Dey: We don't need to write it in the equation. We just need to assume it to figure out the value of the center.
05/07/21, 11:33 pm - Nafisa: Haan toh ye extra toh rhe jaa raha hainna
05/07/21, 11:34 pm - Nafisa: But should the square not have terms from the equation?
05/07/21, 11:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, that's why you add k²/4 and then subtract it too.
05/07/21, 11:34 pm - Raktim Dey: .
05/07/21, 11:34 pm - Nafisa: Then the other one stays na
05/07/21, 11:34 pm - Nafisa: Which is not there
05/07/21, 11:35 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm calling.
05/07/21, 11:35 pm - Nafisa: Wait

06/07/21, 11:38 am - Nafisa: I wanna apply there but it seems too tuff for me

06/07/21, 7:45 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
06/07/21, 7:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Put z=c.
06/07/21, 7:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Here, z=f(x,y)=2-x²-y².
Put z=c. So, x²+y²=2-c=C'.
06/07/21, 7:52 pm - Nafisa: Why?
06/07/21, 7:53 pm - Raktim Dey: That's the definition of level curves.
06/07/21, 7:53 pm - Raktim Dey: PD ne sem 4 me karwaya tha.
06/07/21, 7:53 pm - Raktim Dey: I told you about this toh, to read from multivariate.
06/07/21, 7:54 pm - Nafisa: I started
06/07/21, 7:54 pm - Nafisa: I don't understand anything
06/07/21, 7:54 pm - Raktim Dey: Ask me.
06/07/21, 7:54 pm - Nafisa: I just did
06/07/21, 7:54 pm - Raktim Dey: Not just the problems. Theorems me doubt ho toh pooch lena.
06/07/21, 7:55 pm - Nafisa: The last thing we did was vector field
06/07/21, 7:55 pm - Nafisa: Level sets nahi karaya tha
06/07/21, 7:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Level set uske pehle tha.
06/07/21, 7:55 pm - Nafisa: I have nothing in my notes
06/07/21, 7:55 pm - Raktim Dey: PD didn't teach it properly, because he doesn't understand it.
06/07/21, 7:56 pm - Raktim Dey: Obviously.

06/07/21, 7:56 pm - Nafisa: Because your life sucks
06/07/21, 7:56 pm - Raktim Dey: There are two things to remember from level sets.
06/07/21, 7:57 pm - Raktim Dey: One is this, the equation of level curves. The second is equation of tangent to the curve f(x,y) at (a,b,c).
06/07/21, 8:02 pm - Nafisa: Ok
06/07/21, 8:03 pm - Nafisa: YouTube dekh rahi huun
06/07/21, 8:03 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.

06/07/21, 8:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay. Thanks, I guess.😂
06/07/21, 8:23 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
06/07/21, 8:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Basically, it's fx(x-a)+fy (y-b)+fz(z-c)=0.
06/07/21, 8:24 pm - Raktim Dey: fx means df/dx.
06/07/21, 8:24 pm - Nafisa: Ok
06/07/21, 8:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Grad f =(fx,fy,fz).
06/07/21, 8:24 pm - Nafisa: Got it

08/07/21, 9:38 pm - Nafisa: I did this type yesterday
08/07/21, 9:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
08/07/21, 9:39 pm - Nafisa: But different formula
08/07/21, 9:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha. This is sum, not the number of divisors.
08/07/21, 9:39 pm - Nafisa: Not same type
08/07/21, 9:39 pm - Nafisa: No no not even that
08/07/21, 9:40 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
08/07/21, 9:40 pm - Nafisa: Thanks bro for that sum

08/07/21, 9:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I did this one.
08/07/21, 9:49 pm - Raktim Dey: University nahi hai. It's a entrance book.
08/07/21, 9:57 pm - Nafisa: O
08/07/21, 10:09 pm - Nafisa: Raktim can you get me Pune ka math ka question paper please?
08/07/21, 10:13 pm - Raktim Dey: There were only two question paper available. One of 2019, one of 2013.
08/07/21, 10:14 pm - Raktim Dey: The questions were difficult and out of syllabus. Things that aren't in any BSc courses. So I was confused. It's better if you ask someone who's studying there.
08/07/21, 10:14 pm - Raktim Dey: Sayantani Di studies there. Do you know her?
08/07/21, 10:18 pm - Nafisa: Amrita di said nahi milega
08/07/21, 10:18 pm - Nafisa: The math course seems not so great for me, it has complex analysis, and bla bla
08/07/21, 10:19 pm - Raktim Dey: The industrial math one is good.
08/07/21, 10:19 pm - Nafisa: But its three years ka
08/07/21, 10:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
08/07/21, 10:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Did you check BHU?
08/07/21, 10:20 pm - Nafisa: BHU kya hain ab?
08/07/21, 10:20 pm - Raktim Dey: Banaras Hindu University.
08/07/21, 10:21 pm - Nafisa: No
08/07/21, 10:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
08/07/21, 10:21 pm - Nafisa: The Hindu falls under Du
08/07/21, 10:21 pm - Nafisa: ?
08/07/21, 10:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Hindu College?
08/07/21, 10:21 pm - Nafisa: Yes
08/07/21, 10:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
08/07/21, 10:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Why?
08/07/21, 10:21 pm - Nafisa: Where is that
08/07/21, 10:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Delhi me
08/07/21, 10:21 pm - Raktim Dey: .
08/07/21, 10:22 pm - Raktim Dey: This is in UP.
08/07/21, 10:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Anyway, there's still Jadavpur.
08/07/21, 10:22 pm - Nafisa: Today one uncle said he did masters from there in Dad's office when I asked Dad he is new and he is already earning 1 lakh per month
08/07/21, 10:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Hindu College?
08/07/21, 10:23 pm - Nafisa: My father will kill me if i apply here and when he asked me for Aligarh I didn't
08/07/21, 10:23 pm - Nafisa: Haanji
08/07/21, 10:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, good point. I wouldn't either.
08/07/21, 10:23 pm - Nafisa: Mereko ab DU main karna hain
08/07/21, 10:24 pm - Raktim Dey: See, it's a good college, obviously. But just because his salary is 1lakh doesn't mean that it's because of the college only. Maybe someone got him the job.
08/07/21, 10:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Anything is possible.
08/07/21, 10:24 pm - Nafisa: Abbe lawdu
08/07/21, 10:25 pm - Nafisa: I'm just saying
08/07/21, 10:25 pm - Nafisa: Math is good choice
08/07/21, 10:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Obviously.
08/07/21, 10:25 pm - Nafisa: Even I know I may end up bhaji wala with masters in math
08/07/21, 10:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Probably not.
08/07/21, 10:26 pm - Nafisa: Ok so, 1 saal extra nahi padhna but job chahiye,  so Pune ka math ya industrial math?
08/07/21, 10:26 pm - Nafisa: Anything is possible
08/07/21, 10:26 pm - Nafisa: If i didn't get, thats a different case
08/07/21, 10:26 pm - Raktim Dey: Industrial wala de sakte ho, but exam centers check kar lena. But I'm sure tumhe DU mil jayega.
08/07/21, 10:27 pm - Nafisa: DU ka syllabus is vast that uncle said
08/07/21, 10:27 pm - Raktim Dey: Uncle ya bhaiya?
08/07/21, 10:27 pm - Nafisa: And DU main mereko kiu milega? How do you know
08/07/21, 10:28 pm - Raktim Dey: Question is comparatively easier.
08/07/21, 10:28 pm - Nafisa: He didn't look like a bhaiya though
08/07/21, 10:28 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
08/07/21, 10:28 pm - Raktim Dey: Jamia bhi toh hai.
08/07/21, 10:28 pm - Raktim Dey: CU hai.
08/07/21, 10:29 pm - Nafisa: My father's office got recruitment of new officers and two of them are math people, one was physics
08/07/21, 10:29 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha. Sab ek saath?
08/07/21, 10:29 pm - Nafisa: Iska toh entrances nahi ho sakta hain tumne bola?
08/07/21, 10:29 pm - Nafisa: Mane?
08/07/21, 10:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Abhi tak kuch bola nahi hai. But Xavier's ko preference milta hai generally.
08/07/21, 10:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Ek saath sabka recruitment hua?
08/07/21, 10:30 pm - Nafisa: Nono, months gap was there
08/07/21, 10:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.

08/07/21, 10:36 pm - Nafisa: Probably not
08/07/21, 10:36 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.😂😂
08/07/21, 10:37 pm - Nafisa: We are not the type to stick to each other na
08/07/21, 10:37 pm - Nafisa: So yeah
08/07/21, 10:37 pm - Raktim Dey: Pehle University kisko kaunsa mile wo finalize ho.😂
08/07/21, 10:38 pm - Nafisa: 😭😭
08/07/21, 10:38 pm - Nafisa: I really wanna skip this phase
08/07/21, 10:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Why? It could be fun.
08/07/21, 10:38 pm - Raktim Dey: You could meet some guy.
08/07/21, 10:39 pm - Nafisa: Guy😂
08/07/21, 10:39 pm - Nafisa: Or Gaayy (cow)

08/07/21, 10:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Ladka.
08/07/21, 10:40 pm - Nafisa: You didn't get the sarcasm? Or you chose to ignore?
08/07/21, 10:40 pm - Raktim Dey: I got it, but I was serious about this.
08/07/21, 10:40 pm - Nafisa: Okok
08/07/21, 10:41 pm - Nafisa: I can never be serious here, whenever I get serious I cry
08/07/21, 10:41 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣🤣
08/07/21, 10:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Wow.😂
08/07/21, 10:41 pm - Raktim Dey: It's not really crying wala topic though.
08/07/21, 10:41 pm - Nafisa: Raktim you applying to Pune?
08/07/21, 10:41 pm - Raktim Dey: No.
08/07/21, 10:41 pm - Nafisa: Haan got it

08/07/21, 10:41 pm - Nafisa: Okay
08/07/21, 10:42 pm - Nafisa: No, the math one
08/07/21, 10:42 pm - Raktim Dey: No.
08/07/21, 10:42 pm - Nafisa: Ok
08/07/21, 10:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Delhi, Hyderabad ye sab toh hai.
08/07/21, 10:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Rkmveri too, for me.
08/07/21, 10:43 pm - Nafisa: I will apply here and I have Jamia, should i still go for Pune?
08/07/21, 10:43 pm - Nafisa: Last year online hua tha
08/07/21, 10:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Online hoga toh kar do. Travel nahi karna parega. Not much jhamela
08/07/21, 10:43 pm - Raktim Dey: .
08/07/21, 10:43 pm - Nafisa: Haan
08/07/21, 10:43 pm - Raktim Dey: But if they say ki camera on rakhna parega, will you manage with your net?
08/07/21, 10:44 pm - Nafisa: I have to keep more options now, entrances cancel hue toh baas.
08/07/21, 10:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Presidency ka shayad alag se exam hoga. They took money after all.
08/07/21, 10:44 pm - Nafisa: If I don't then kya hi kar sakte hain
08/07/21, 10:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
08/07/21, 10:45 pm - Nafisa: Yes, they better use it or return
08/07/21, 10:45 pm - Raktim Dey: They will. College toh chalana parega.
08/07/21, 10:45 pm - Raktim Dey: PG ka I'm guessing hoga exam.
08/07/21, 10:45 pm - Nafisa: Hoga bhi toh Amrita di told bohot high competition hota hain
08/07/21, 10:46 pm - Nafisa: I really don't have any hope for it now
08/07/21, 10:46 pm - Raktim Dey: Competition toh sab universities me hi hoga.
08/07/21, 10:46 pm - Raktim Dey: Don't worry about competition. Bohot colleges hai.
08/07/21, 10:46 pm - Nafisa: My God. You are such optimistic here.
08/07/21, 10:46 pm - Raktim Dey: See, if you're thinking of Pune, then do Rkmveri instead na.
08/07/21, 10:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Of course.
08/07/21, 10:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Dono hi toh pure maths hai.
08/07/21, 10:47 pm - Raktim Dey: No no forget it.
08/07/21, 10:47 pm - Nafisa: No
08/07/21, 10:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Not after what Saikat  Da said.
08/07/21, 10:47 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
08/07/21, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Anyway, presidency hai, JU CU bhi niklega.
08/07/21, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: So lot of options.
08/07/21, 10:48 pm - Nafisa: Wait Pune ka math ka course is pure?
08/07/21, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't remember.
08/07/21, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Industrial wala nahi hai.
08/07/21, 10:48 pm - Nafisa: See na please
08/07/21, 10:48 pm - Nafisa: If pure I'm not applying
08/07/21, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay. I'll check and tell you in a bit.
08/07/21, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: I have to go eat now.
08/07/21, 10:48 pm - Nafisa: Thats not an option for me, teen sal nahi padh sakti
08/07/21, 10:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
08/07/21, 10:49 pm - Nafisa: Okok
08/07/21, 11:05 pm - Raktim Dey: For the math course, it's pure maths. Algebra analysis topology differential geometry etc.
08/07/21, 11:06 pm - Raktim Dey: And the industrial one, waha pe 3 years hai, but the last semester is IT project, which is an internship, so probably job related hoga. So you have to study for 5 semesters and sixth me internship. You'll be paid too for that.
09/07/21, 6:31 am - Nafisa: Thank you :)
09/07/21, 2:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Hyderabad released something.
09/07/21, 2:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Not the dates.
09/07/21, 2:44 pm - Raktim Dey: But they said that there will be there days for all the entrances. Maths will be on the first day, 12-2 pm.

09/07/21, 2:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Keeps you in suspense.
09/07/21, 2:47 pm - Nafisa: Fuck them
09/07/21, 2:47 pm - Nafisa: I like it when I have popcorn to enjoy, not when I have to book tickets
09/07/21, 2:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Maybe you won't have to travel na. Aizawl me ho gaya toh achha hai.
09/07/21, 2:48 pm - Nafisa: Nahi hua toh? They give us our second choice or they decide something, wo bhi nahi pata
09/07/21, 2:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Three choices denge.
09/07/21, 2:49 pm - Nafisa: Date kab hain madarchod

10/07/21, 9:44 pm - Raktim Dey: I am critical about everything. So it'd be hypocritical if I'm not critical about myself as well.
10/07/21, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: Back to back something not happening feels ugh. Meresaat wahi ho raha hain, trust me
10/07/21, 9:44 pm - Nafisa: .....
10/07/21, 9:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. Jab tak college na mile, ye nahi jayega.
10/07/21, 9:45 pm - Nafisa: Since I joined college, I feel I did nothing which has improved me or I have learned anything for my career or to support my career
10/07/21, 9:45 pm - Nafisa: My friends not doing much stressing are getting through what they want, two of them got a job already
10/07/21, 9:47 pm - Nafisa: That pressure when your parents ask you what your plan. That pressure when you know you actually lowkey know what you are doing rn is not what  you wanted but anyways you have to carry on
10/07/21, 9:47 pm - Nafisa: Yeah. I know what you are feeling, I really do.
10/07/21, 9:48 pm - Nafisa: But trust me things will be good in long term or we will learn to handle it hopefully in a good way
10/07/21, 9:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Everything you said is right. Except the last part where you turned optimistic.
10/07/21, 9:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Joke.
10/07/21, 9:48 pm - Nafisa: The or part is true
10/07/21, 9:48 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
10/07/21, 9:49 pm - Nafisa: We all learn to handle pain with time
10/07/21, 9:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Absolutely.
10/07/21, 9:49 pm - Nafisa: I don't believe in healing everytime. Not everything heals
10/07/21, 9:49 pm - Nafisa: Never
10/07/21, 9:49 pm - Nafisa: It stays till death
10/07/21, 9:50 pm - Nafisa: But when you learn to use that in a smart way, you learn to stay in peace
10/07/21, 9:51 pm - Nafisa: The only thing i crave for is peace. My inner Peace. But it seems too much to ask even for this
10/07/21, 9:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Peace seems like something we could have easily, but it never is. Somehow we have to work for that too.
10/07/21, 9:52 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't know, maybe job milne ke baad if I stay alone, tab proper peace milega.
10/07/21, 9:52 pm - Nafisa: Yeah. Being adult and realising amd understanding everything happening around sucks. The more understanding you become, the harder life gets
10/07/21, 9:53 pm - Raktim Dey: All of a sudden you seem so grown up.
10/07/21, 9:53 pm - Nafisa: Hopefully.
10/07/21, 9:53 pm - Nafisa: Little one, don't go in my size
10/07/21, 9:53 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
10/07/21, 9:53 pm - Raktim Dey: Obviously not.😂
10/07/21, 9:54 pm - Nafisa: Well

10/07/21, 9:54 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂just kidding
10/07/21, 9:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Let's hope it's true.
10/07/21, 9:55 pm - Nafisa: Fuck you
10/07/21, 9:55 pm - Nafisa: What makes you negative here
10/07/21, 9:55 pm - Nafisa: Thappad padega
10/07/21, 9:55 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂😂
10/07/21, 9:56 pm - Nafisa: Omg. I feel I can read behind your messages
10/07/21, 9:56 pm - Nafisa: You play so safe
10/07/21, 9:56 pm - Nafisa: Very smart.
10/07/21, 9:56 pm - Raktim Dey: I hide my true colours for face to face meetings.
10/07/21, 9:57 pm - Raktim Dey: That is such a great line.
10/07/21, 10:10 pm - Nafisa: 🤦‍♀😂😂
10/07/21, 10:10 pm - Nafisa: You try hiding many things about yourself
10/07/21, 10:10 pm - Nafisa: Sometimes you just Yes to avoid that part of conversation
10/07/21, 10:11 pm - Nafisa: Sometimes you just play along for the other person to feel better
10/07/21, 10:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes. Actually it helps if the person you're talking to is nice.
10/07/21, 10:22 pm - Nafisa: Haan and you talk to only people you feel are nice
10/07/21, 10:22 pm - Nafisa: You don't risk it
10/07/21, 10:28 pm - Raktim Dey: Well. I think there are time for risking it. But those are very rare.

31/07/21, 10:06 pm - Raktim Dey: They asked if I shaved my head or not. Dipanjan and Sourajyoti.
31/07/21, 10:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Debmalya sabko candy de raha tha.
31/07/21, 10:40 pm - Nafisa: Sigh
01/08/21, 11:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Pata hai, I saw Srijan Da and Harshvardhan at the exam hall.

01/08/21, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: What did you do?
01/08/21, 11:21 pm - Raktim Dey: They don't like you?😂
01/08/21, 11:21 pm - Nafisa: I showed so much love :-/
01/08/21, 11:21 pm - Raktim Dey: That can be exhausting.
01/08/21, 11:22 pm - Nafisa: Maybe 😭 maybe they see as competition, I'm also very cute na

01/08/21, 11:23 pm - Nafisa: Nono
01/08/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: Because they were crying so much
01/08/21, 11:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh. Ha, that can be annoying.
01/08/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: They don't like crowd i guess
01/08/21, 11:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Like me.
01/08/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: Very. And I feel so bad when they cry more on my lap
01/08/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: And my sister can handle the.
01/08/21, 11:25 pm - Nafisa: Yes. Maybe your kids from future
01/08/21, 11:25 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't think that's ever gonna happen.😂
01/08/21, 11:25 pm - Nafisa: Broooo
01/08/21, 11:25 pm - Nafisa: You also planned for no kids?
01/08/21, 11:26 pm - Nafisa: Jinxxxx on that
01/08/21, 11:26 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.😂😂
01/08/21, 11:26 pm - Raktim Dey: I haven't planned anything, but I'm not the responsible type, so.😂
01/08/21, 11:26 pm - Raktim Dey: Good for you too.
01/08/21, 11:26 pm - Raktim Dey: Why did you plan that?
01/08/21, 11:27 pm - Nafisa: Because I want that
01/08/21, 11:27 pm - Raktim Dey: Good answer.
01/08/21, 11:27 pm - Nafisa: I don't want to carry a baby crying most of the time
01/08/21, 11:27 pm - Nafisa: Get fat
01/08/21, 11:27 pm - Nafisa: Have a husband to take care
01/08/21, 11:27 pm - Nafisa: Nono
01/08/21, 11:27 pm - Raktim Dey: Get the husband to take care of you.
01/08/21, 11:28 pm - Nafisa: I want little money and a small house for me, comfortable enough to live
01/08/21, 11:28 pm - Nafisa: No taking care becomes my duty too.
01/08/21, 11:28 pm - Nafisa: Its a contract.
01/08/21, 11:29 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, all that legal forms.
01/08/21, 11:29 pm - Raktim Dey: That sounds really nice.
01/08/21, 11:29 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't know what I want. All I know is what I don't want.
01/08/21, 11:31 pm - Nafisa: Yes
01/08/21, 11:33 pm - Nafisa: My friend told me its unhealthy for my mental health to focus on what I don't want.
01/08/21, 11:36 pm - Raktim Dey: So what should we focus on?
01/08/21, 11:37 pm - Nafisa: What we want
01/08/21, 11:37 pm - Nafisa: What we don't want, wo toh apne aap rahega saat
01/08/21, 11:37 pm - Nafisa: Focus on this, it will motivate you to not give up
01/08/21, 11:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I tried that too. But not getting what you want can be very disappointing.
01/08/21, 11:38 pm - Nafisa: Ofcourse
01/08/21, 11:38 pm - Nafisa: But that can't and should not stop us from dreaming
01/08/21, 11:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know.
01/08/21, 11:39 pm - Nafisa: Potty karne ka man nahi karta toh khaana chod deta hain kya?
01/08/21, 11:39 pm - Nafisa: Nahi na
01/08/21, 11:39 pm - Nafisa: Khaata toh hainna
01/08/21, 11:39 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't think that logic works at all.😂
01/08/21, 11:39 pm - Nafisa: So like that, everything has a consequence but that shouldn't stop you from planning or dreaming
01/08/21, 11:40 pm - Nafisa: It does. Think nicely
01/08/21, 11:40 pm - Nafisa: My mom bartan dhone ke dar se tu khaana chod deti hain, itna aalas theek nahi
01/08/21, 11:40 pm - Nafisa: Says*
01/08/21, 11:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, this logic is better.
01/08/21, 11:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I still dream about studying abroad. MSc nahi hua, toh maybe PhD, if I want to pursue it.
01/08/21, 11:41 pm - Nafisa: Potty is bad or what
01/08/21, 11:42 pm - Raktim Dey: No, but eating and pottying are something that's not about dreaming. You have to do that no matter what.
01/08/21, 11:42 pm - Nafisa: Dekh, job dhundle, thora experience lele then apply for abroad, easily travel kar payega
01/08/21, 11:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Dekhte hai.
01/08/21, 11:42 pm - Nafisa: You didn't get my logic. Biology padhana padega tereko
01/08/21, 11:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Aj exam ke baad main, Mayurakshi aur Sourajyoti khaane gaye the.
01/08/21, 11:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, maybe.
01/08/21, 11:43 pm - Nafisa: Mayurakshi went out with Sourajyoti
01/08/21, 11:43 pm - Nafisa: Wow
01/08/21, 11:43 pm - Raktim Dey: I was there too.
01/08/21, 11:43 pm - Nafisa: That gurl is really nice person
01/08/21, 11:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Why?😂
01/08/21, 11:44 pm - Nafisa: Lol
01/08/21, 11:44 pm - Nafisa: How did she manage with you both
01/08/21, 11:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Manage karne ka kuch nahi tha.😂
01/08/21, 11:44 pm - Nafisa: I can't go eat with someone if I don't like them much
01/08/21, 11:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Mayurakshi aur main ja raha tha khaane, raaste me Sourajyoti dikh gaya, so he came with us.
01/08/21, 11:44 pm - Nafisa: Tune baat kya?
01/08/21, 11:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Sourajyoti and Mayurakshi are good friends.
01/08/21, 11:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Ha.
01/08/21, 11:45 pm - Nafisa: I hate this
01/08/21, 11:45 pm - Nafisa: Wow
01/08/21, 11:45 pm - Raktim Dey: What?
01/08/21, 11:45 pm - Nafisa: Sourajyoti
01/08/21, 11:45 pm - Nafisa: Coming in middle of a plan
01/08/21, 11:45 pm - Nafisa: Whenvi didn't invite you
01/08/21, 11:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Arre, unka project GT ke under tha na, so they became good friends I guess.
01/08/21, 11:46 pm - Nafisa: Just friends hoga
01/08/21, 11:46 pm - Raktim Dey: We invited him when we went to the restaurant. Wo nahi aa raha tha
01/08/21, 11:46 pm - Raktim Dey: .
01/08/21, 11:46 pm - Nafisa: Good friends is alot to ask
01/08/21, 11:46 pm - Raktim Dey: Ha, maybe.
01/08/21, 11:46 pm - Nafisa: You are nice people
01/08/21, 11:46 pm - Nafisa: Very nice
01/08/21, 11:47 pm - Raktim Dey: It was Sourajyoti. Dipanjan ya Debmalya hota toh thori na bolte.
01/08/21, 11:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Plus Mayurakshi doesn't like Dipanjan.
01/08/21, 11:47 pm - Nafisa: Once when eco park we were going sej invited Sourajyoti when she saw him on the way, i pinched her
01/08/21, 11:47 pm - Raktim Dey: I remember.😂
01/08/21, 11:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Wow Momo me.

01/08/21, 11:48 pm - Nafisa: When i don't want something
01/08/21, 11:48 pm - Nafisa: Learnt it from parents 🤭
01/08/21, 11:48 pm - Raktim Dey: I wonder how big your eyes are when you talk with Debmalya.
01/08/21, 11:48 pm - Nafisa: Duh! Debmalya hota toh he would force himself in it
01/08/21, 11:49 pm - Nafisa: Ahahahahshgjgdds
01/08/21, 11:49 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't think so. He maintains a proper distance from me.😂
01/08/21, 11:49 pm - Nafisa: Good
01/08/21, 11:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
01/08/21, 11:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Aj ka exam bohot lengthy tha mera.
01/08/21, 11:49 pm - Nafisa: I don't like so so many people now
01/08/21, 11:50 pm - Nafisa: Achha. But overall good?
01/08/21, 11:50 pm - Raktim Dey: That's smart. Like me.
01/08/21, 11:50 pm - Nafisa: Thank u
01/08/21, 11:50 pm - Raktim Dey: I guess. Result nikal ne baad pata chalega. There was a lot of stress on math. Computer ya stats walo ke liye problem hoga.
01/08/21, 11:50 pm - Raktim Dey: And it was tougher than last three years.
01/08/21, 11:50 pm - Nafisa: O
01/08/21, 11:51 pm - Nafisa: :/
01/08/21, 11:51 pm - Nafisa: Fine only, you gave what you had to
01/08/21, 11:51 pm - Nafisa: Enough
01/08/21, 11:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know.
01/08/21, 11:51 pm - Nafisa: My days are going on serving food to guests and baby sitting
01/08/21, 11:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Why?
01/08/21, 11:52 pm - Nafisa: Housewife wala feeling  aata hain
01/08/21, 11:52 pm - Raktim Dey: That doesn't sound fun.
01/08/21, 11:52 pm - Nafisa: Naya ghar main shift hue, so guests everyday
01/08/21, 11:52 pm - Nafisa: Nope
01/08/21, 11:52 pm - Raktim Dey: I hate guests.
01/08/21, 11:52 pm - Nafisa: Just the babies are always small and cute
01/08/21, 11:52 pm - Nafisa: And doesn't stay for long
01/08/21, 11:53 pm - Raktim Dey: But they cry.😂

01/08/21, 11:53 pm - Nafisa: If i was to be a Mom
01/08/21, 11:53 pm - Nafisa: I would be a Mean one
01/08/21, 11:54 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't know about that. People change when they have kids.
01/08/21, 11:54 pm - Nafisa: Yes, you think I'm mean now?
01/08/21, 11:54 pm - Nafisa: 😒
01/08/21, 11:54 pm - Raktim Dey: Arre, not that.😂
01/08/21, 11:54 pm - Nafisa: Thats the change i thought
01/08/21, 11:55 pm - Raktim Dey: I mean now you think that you'll be mean. But if you become a mother, you might not feel the same way.
01/08/21, 11:55 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣🤣
01/08/21, 11:55 pm - Nafisa: With all the chaos I may kill the kid myself
01/08/21, 11:56 pm - Nafisa: Don't worry about the mentally ill part
01/08/21, 11:56 pm - Raktim Dey: It's fine.😂
01/08/21, 11:56 pm - Raktim Dey: Anyway, ye sab bohot dur ki baat hai.
01/08/21, 11:56 pm - Nafisa: Kaha dur
01/08/21, 11:57 pm - Nafisa: People settle by 28
01/08/21, 11:57 pm - Nafisa: I'm already 22
01/08/21, 11:57 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂😂
01/08/21, 11:57 pm - Raktim Dey: Maybe you won't have to settle. You'll find someone you like.
01/08/21, 11:58 pm - Nafisa: Someone like me
01/08/21, 11:58 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
01/08/21, 11:58 pm - Nafisa: Ek loti single gem huun main
01/08/21, 11:58 pm - Raktim Dey: That's true.
01/08/21, 11:58 pm - Nafisa: Why
01/08/21, 11:58 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
01/08/21, 11:58 pm - Nafisa: Why do you agree
01/08/21, 11:58 pm - Raktim Dey: You are one of a kind.😂
01/08/21, 11:59 pm - Nafisa: But to balance a relationship we need unlike people not like ones
01/08/21, 11:59 pm - Nafisa: You really think so? 😂😂
01/08/21, 11:59 pm - Raktim Dey: It doesn't work that way.
01/08/21, 11:59 pm - Raktim Dey: You don't choose whom you'll fall for.
01/08/21, 11:59 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.😂
02/08/21, 12:00 am - Nafisa: Mere jesa gussa wala hua koi then we will end up killing each other na. Someone calm has to handle my chaos
02/08/21, 12:00 am - Nafisa: Yeah. Unfortunately
02/08/21, 12:01 am - Nafisa: But I guess I can stay with just loving him for life without him knowing it. Thats more peaceful for me
02/08/21, 12:01 am - Raktim Dey: That sounds complicated.
02/08/21, 12:01 am - Nafisa: Nahi re
02/08/21, 12:01 am - Nafisa: Math se kam hi complicated hain
02/08/21, 12:02 am - Nafisa: Dekh when I like him, only I know and I enjoy the emotions
02/08/21, 12:02 am - Raktim Dey: No no no, it's not. It's much more complicated than mechanics and analysis.
02/08/21, 12:02 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
02/08/21, 12:02 am - Nafisa: He doesn't get to know it and my chance of getting hurt goes to 0
02/08/21, 12:03 am - Nafisa: I may block u for mentioning those in particular 😤
02/08/21, 12:03 am - Raktim Dey: 😂😂
02/08/21, 12:03 am - Raktim Dey: Okay.

02/08/21, 12:03 am - Nafisa: Very stupid logic okay
02/08/21, 12:03 am - Nafisa: But my mechanism to protect myself
02/08/21, 12:04 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I understood that.
02/08/21, 12:05 am - Nafisa: 💃
02/08/21, 12:05 am - Nafisa: Its raining here

02/08/21, 12:08 am - Nafisa: Its a plain area

05/08/21, 11:20 pm - Nafisa: He went to depression so couldn't continue
05/08/21, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: It seems so obvious and so confusing at the same time.
05/08/21, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: Kyu?
05/08/21, 11:20 pm - Nafisa: Abhi mat daroa ,read that
05/08/21, 11:21 pm - Raktim Dey: I read it.
05/08/21, 11:21 pm - Nafisa: Lol. I'm a timepass chat for him, I got it now
05/08/21, 11:21 pm - Nafisa: Have been through this kind of people
05/08/21, 11:21 pm - Nafisa: So I know what he is doing
05/08/21, 11:21 pm - Nafisa: Just a time pass. When he feels low or bored
05/08/21, 11:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, maybe. But you don't really think of him as a close friend or anything, so it's fine.
05/08/21, 11:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Right?
05/08/21, 11:22 pm - Nafisa: What?
05/08/21, 11:22 pm - Nafisa: Didn't get you?
05/08/21, 11:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Matlab it's possible that he thinks of you as time pass chat, but you think the same too.
05/08/21, 11:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Right?
05/08/21, 11:23 pm - Raktim Dey: He's not really a close friend of yours.
05/08/21, 11:23 pm - Raktim Dey: So there's no chance of getting hurt.
05/08/21, 11:23 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂😂
05/08/21, 11:23 pm - Nafisa: Lol
05/08/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: He is nothing for me
05/08/21, 11:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Exactly.
05/08/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: Not hurt but anger when I feel used
05/08/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: And Now I make sure I smash the person who does it or cut them off my life
05/08/21, 11:26 pm - Nafisa: Debmalya does this stupid shit becoz maybe somewhere he thinks I like him becoz of his over confidence or he likes talking to me when he is free, the thing that irritates me is his stupid talks where he thinks he is being very smart or playing very smartly by flirting and sometimes calling me sister
05/08/21, 11:27 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I get it. But he's clearly not being smart, because it's obvious from his messages. And also, he's not good at flirting. That's not even flirting. Take it from me.
05/08/21, 11:27 pm - Nafisa: I know
05/08/21, 11:27 pm - Nafisa: His over confidence
05/08/21, 11:28 pm - Nafisa: Ugh
05/08/21, 11:28 pm - Raktim Dey: No, I mean I'm good at flirting and I can tell from his messages that he's not.
05/08/21, 11:28 pm - Nafisa: Can't be rude becoz he goes to this line saying he is mentally ill and all
05/08/21, 11:28 pm - Nafisa: Really? Wow. I didn't know you are😂
05/08/21, 11:28 pm - Raktim Dey: Pata nahi. Maybe he's saying the truth, maybe he's lying about all that.
05/08/21, 11:28 pm - Raktim Dey: I have a lot of hidden talents.
05/08/21, 11:29 pm - Nafisa: But can't take chance when it comes to mental health
05/08/21, 11:29 pm - Raktim Dey: Ha, wahi.
05/08/21, 11:29 pm - Nafisa: Or maybe you think you have them
05/08/21, 11:29 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
05/08/21, 11:29 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, maybe.
05/08/21, 11:29 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂
05/08/21, 11:29 pm - Nafisa: I'm just having fun

05/08/21, 11:30 pm - Nafisa: We are far from border
05/08/21, 11:30 pm - Nafisa: Very far actually
05/08/21, 11:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha. That's good.
05/08/21, 11:30 pm - Raktim Dey: But border cross nahi kar sakte na?
05/08/21, 11:31 pm - Raktim Dey: Kolkata aa jaao. It'll be fun. I'm getting bored.😂
05/08/21, 11:39 pm - Nafisa: Abhi tak nahi
05/08/21, 11:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Debmalya is texting me.
05/08/21, 11:39 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂 Again feeling used.
05/08/21, 11:40 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣

05/08/21, 11:43 pm - Nafisa: Haan
05/08/21, 11:44 pm - Nafisa: Maybe he texts so many people in a day
05/08/21, 11:44 pm - Raktim Dey: How many people do you text in a day?
05/08/21, 11:45 pm - Nafisa: I don't
05/08/21, 11:45 pm - Nafisa: Mostly

05/08/21, 11:47 pm - Nafisa: That girl. I don't like her anymore

05/08/21, 11:50 pm - Nafisa: She will
05/08/21, 11:50 pm - Raktim Dey: You know, this kind of reminds me of Anusua and Sohini.
05/08/21, 11:50 pm - Nafisa: No Anusua is nice
05/08/21, 11:50 pm - Nafisa: She is real

05/08/21, 11:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, that's true.
05/08/21, 11:51 pm - Raktim Dey: She only texts me when she needs some kind of help.
05/08/21, 11:52 pm - Raktim Dey: Although I had to text her last week to tell Sagarika to return my book.
05/08/21, 11:52 pm - Raktim Dey: She sent it to me by courier.
05/08/21, 11:52 pm - Nafisa: O

05/08/21, 11:53 pm - Raktim Dey: Although I'd really like to know who it is. 😂
05/08/21, 11:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Do you talk to Ujaan?
05/08/21, 11:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Aajkal I mean.

06/08/21, 12:07 am - Raktim Dey: It's not really a game. It's fantasy football.
06/08/21, 12:08 am - Nafisa: Building fantasies with him. I see🌚
06/08/21, 12:08 am - Raktim Dey: There's this girl in our neighborhood, who was in the same school I was. She just passed class 12. But she wasn't able to afford application forms to more than three colleges. Plus cyber cafe me bohot zyada charge karte hai application ke liye. So I filled her application forms online today.
06/08/21, 12:09 am - Raktim Dey: Plus all the CU colleges are not charging any money for application forms this year.

06/08/21, 12:22 am - Nafisa: But you ever thought?
06/08/21, 12:22 am - Nafisa: Before

07/08/21, 11:14 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.

07/08/21, 11:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Kya pata.
07/08/21, 11:17 pm - Nafisa: But its non abelian?
07/08/21, 11:18 pm - Raktim Dey: Consider D12.
07/08/21, 11:18 pm - Raktim Dey: Order of a³=4, order of a⁴=3, order of a⁷=a is 12.
07/08/21, 11:18 pm - Nafisa: Whats your point?
07/08/21, 11:19 pm - Nafisa: For non abelian its product?
07/08/21, 11:19 pm - Nafisa: And for abelian its lcm of the two?
07/08/21, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: The main point is that their orders are coprime. So LCM hi kiya maine.
07/08/21, 11:20 pm - Nafisa: So whats the point?
07/08/21, 11:20 pm - Nafisa: Lcm hi lena hain?
07/08/21, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
07/08/21, 11:20 pm - Nafisa: Even if non abelian?
07/08/21, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: .
07/08/21, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: Wahi toh hua.
07/08/21, 11:21 pm - Nafisa: Abbe yaar Yes or No main jawab de
07/08/21, 11:21 pm - Nafisa: My brain is not working
07/08/21, 11:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
07/08/21, 11:21 pm - Nafisa: Ok
07/08/21, 11:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Are you sure the question is correct in the first one?
07/08/21, 11:22 pm - Nafisa: Z5[X] is a UFD na?
07/08/21, 11:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
07/08/21, 11:22 pm - Nafisa: Yes it was written so
07/08/21, 11:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Z5 is a field, so Z5x is an ED.
07/08/21, 11:22 pm - Nafisa: Yes Yes
07/08/21, 11:22 pm - Raktim Dey: First option ho nahi sakta. It's greater than 1.
07/08/21, 11:23 pm - Nafisa: I took the whole day to revise everything
07/08/21, 11:23 pm - Nafisa: I feel like vomiting
07/08/21, 11:23 pm - Nafisa: Kal dekhti huun again. Sorry. I need to sleep, I feel sick
07/08/21, 11:24 pm - Raktim Dey: I'd say it's a bad thing, but it's not.
07/08/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: I'm so very scared
07/08/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: What is bad?
07/08/21, 11:24 pm - Raktim Dey: I understand. But you're scared means you are properly prepared. I'm sure you'll go great.
07/08/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: Nono
07/08/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: All will go to waste
07/08/21, 11:24 pm - Nafisa: My father is so tensed
07/08/21, 11:25 pm - Nafisa: Already northeast ka so much problem while travelling
07/08/21, 11:25 pm - Nafisa: I need this

07/08/21, 11:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Don't worry.
07/08/21, 11:25 pm - Nafisa: Delhi ka toh apply bhi nahi kiya
07/08/21, 11:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Bohot time hai abhi bhi.
07/08/21, 11:25 pm - Nafisa: Himmat nahi hua to ask him
07/08/21, 11:26 pm - Nafisa: I will give Jamia and thankfully 30th ko hi results will be out
07/08/21, 11:26 pm - Nafisa: So I will know if I have to apply for colleges like Kalyani and Aliah
07/08/21, 11:26 pm - Nafisa: Udhar nahi jaana. Achha college chahiye
07/08/21, 11:27 pm - Raktim Dey: Jamia me mil jayega I'm sure. Plus DU toh hai hi.
07/08/21, 11:28 pm - Nafisa: Ben didn't even prepare for JAM last time he got 900 something rank. Lord, he is so smart, Paulie already got a college, you did your recent entrance well , everyone is doing good, mereko bhi chahiye
07/08/21, 11:28 pm - Nafisa: Last date is 21st na to apply for DU?
07/08/21, 11:29 pm - Raktim Dey: Main check karke bata dunga, but it's after 20th.
07/08/21, 11:29 pm - Nafisa: Haan its 21st only
07/08/21, 11:29 pm - Nafisa: I checked yesterday
07/08/21, 11:29 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
07/08/21, 11:29 pm - Nafisa: But tum bhi dekhna
07/08/21, 11:30 pm - Nafisa: Its so problematic, I have to go back to Aizawl and then again go to Kolkata for documents and then again for hyderabad ka entrance
07/08/21, 11:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Hyderabad ka entrance ka toh center hi confirm nahi hua abtak.
07/08/21, 11:31 pm - Nafisa: Haan
07/08/21, 11:31 pm - Nafisa: Aizawl toh nahi hoga
07/08/21, 11:31 pm - Raktim Dey: Toh Kolkata hoga. Ek baar me ho jayega.
07/08/21, 11:31 pm - Nafisa: Haan
07/08/21, 11:31 pm - Nafisa: Wahi soch rahi thi
07/08/21, 11:31 pm - Nafisa: Chal bye
07/08/21, 11:32 pm - Nafisa: Please kardena, if i can't understand i may call you if thats okay
07/08/21, 11:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Ha ha, I'll send you by tomorrow.
07/08/21, 11:49 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
07/08/21, 11:49 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
07/08/21, 11:50 pm - Raktim Dey: I couldn't do the third one.
08/08/21, 7:20 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
08/08/21, 8:36 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
08/08/21, 10:02 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
08/08/21, 12:35 pm - Raktim Dey: Bernoulli's formula. It's actually 10c7 (0.5)⁷(1-0.5)³.
08/08/21, 12:36 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, it is.
08/08/21, 12:38 pm - Raktim Dey: No limit point, because 3ⁿ is divergent.
08/08/21, 1:19 pm - Nafisa: So my answer is correct na? And what about net ka answer?
08/08/21, 1:23 pm - Raktim Dey: They are both correct, because it's negative in both cases.
08/08/21, 1:25 pm - Raktim Dey: See, it's negative in both cases, but (1,1) is not a critical point. So wo nahi hoga.
08/08/21, 1:37 pm - Nafisa: Critical point nikalne ke liye we do fx=0 and fy=0 na?
08/08/21, 1:37 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
08/08/21, 1:38 pm - Nafisa: Ok
08/08/21, 1:38 pm - Nafisa: Thanks again
08/08/21, 1:38 pm - Raktim Dey: No problem.
08/08/21, 9:04 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
08/08/21, 9:07 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
08/08/21, 9:09 pm - Nafisa: Why divide?
08/08/21, 9:09 pm - Nafisa: Why not multiply by it?
08/08/21, 9:10 pm - Raktim Dey: Integrating factor se hamesha divide hi karna parta hai. That's the definition of integrating factor.
08/08/21, 9:10 pm - Nafisa: I thought multiply karte hain
08/08/21, 9:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Na.
08/08/21, 9:13 pm - Nafisa: Ok
08/08/21, 9:14 pm - Raktim Dey: Kal flight se jaoge?
08/08/21, 9:16 pm - Nafisa: Haan
08/08/21, 9:16 pm - Raktim Dey: Be careful with the traveling.
08/08/21, 9:16 pm - Nafisa: O well
08/08/21, 9:16 pm - Raktim Dey: Have a safe trip.
08/08/21, 9:17 pm - Nafisa: At this point I want something like COVID to extreme and sie
08/08/21, 9:17 pm - Nafisa: Die*
08/08/21, 9:17 pm - Nafisa: So much done with life now
08/08/21, 9:17 pm - Nafisa: Like its enough I have lived
08/08/21, 9:17 pm - Nafisa: Jk
08/08/21, 9:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Let's keep the deathwish for after completing MSc.
08/08/21, 9:17 pm - Nafisa: Thanks 😊
08/08/21, 9:18 pm - Nafisa: Okay. But for what joy?
08/08/21, 9:18 pm - Nafisa: Thats my expiry date on your life?
08/08/21, 9:18 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
08/08/21, 9:18 pm - Raktim Dey: Agar job nahi mila toh. We could kill each other.
08/08/21, 9:19 pm - Nafisa: No
08/08/21, 9:19 pm - Nafisa: Not you
08/08/21, 9:19 pm - Nafisa: Die together sounds better
08/08/21, 9:19 pm - Raktim Dey: You want to kill someone else?
08/08/21, 9:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha. Yeah, that could work as well.
08/08/21, 9:19 pm - Nafisa: Yes
08/08/21, 9:20 pm - Raktim Dey: Kitne din ke liye Delhi me rahoge?
08/08/21, 9:23 pm - Nafisa: 3days
08/08/21, 9:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
09/08/21, 9:41 am - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
09/08/21, 12:15 pm - Raktim Dey: That's a lot of protection.😂😂
09/08/21, 12:16 pm - Raktim Dey: Did you reach Delhi?
09/08/21, 12:28 pm - Nafisa: Not uet
09/08/21, 12:28 pm - Nafisa: Yet*
09/08/21, 12:29 pm - Nafisa: Bharey much
09/08/21, 12:29 pm - Nafisa: I had coffee and sandwich at tge airport
09/08/21, 12:29 pm - Nafisa: Tasty tha
09/08/21, 12:29 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha. Good.
09/08/21, 12:29 pm - Raktim Dey: Flight kab hai?
09/08/21, 12:30 pm - Nafisa: Connecting flight tha
09/08/21, 12:30 pm - Nafisa: Now borading from Guwahati
09/08/21, 12:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
09/08/21, 12:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Have fun. Have a safe journey.
09/08/21, 12:31 pm - Nafisa: Thank you
09/08/21, 12:31 pm - Raktim Dey: Will you meet Ben?
09/08/21, 12:32 pm - Nafisa: No
09/08/21, 12:32 pm - Nafisa: Unfortunately
09/08/21, 12:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
09/08/21, 12:32 pm - Nafisa: I feel very bad about this
09/08/21, 12:33 pm - Nafisa: I don't meet anyone whenever I come
09/08/21, 12:33 pm - Raktim Dey: Kyu nahi miloge?
09/08/21, 12:33 pm - Nafisa: Baadmain batati huun
09/08/21, 12:33 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
09/08/21, 12:33 pm - Raktim Dey: You met me.😂
09/08/21, 12:33 pm - Raktim Dey: I know I'm special, so yeah.
09/08/21, 12:34 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂😂
09/08/21, 12:34 pm - Nafisa: Okay
09/08/21, 10:06 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
09/08/21, 10:07 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't know. This is from solvability of groups.
09/08/21, 10:07 pm - Raktim Dey: Ek baar Anirban ko pooch sakte ho. He studied this for his dissertation.
09/08/21, 10:21 pm - Nafisa: The abovr statements are true or false?
09/08/21, 10:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Second one is true.
09/08/21, 10:23 pm - Raktim Dey: First one is false. Counterexample: R. Unbounded metric space.
09/08/21, 10:28 pm - Nafisa: Ok
09/08/21, 10:35 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
09/08/21, 10:37 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
09/08/21, 10:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Upar wala question ka shayad option 2.
09/08/21, 10:47 pm - Raktim Dey: 40 ka answer hai option c. It's not onto, because f(x)=1 has no pre image.
09/08/21, 10:50 pm - Raktim Dey: In finite dimensional vector spaces, one one implies onto and vice versa. But not in infinite dimensional ones.
09/08/21, 10:54 pm - Nafisa: Ok
09/08/21, 10:55 pm - Nafisa: 2020 wala main should I spilt 2020?
09/08/21, 10:56 pm - Raktim Dey: That one is slightly difficult, because 12 isn't prime.
09/08/21, 10:56 pm - Nafisa: Yes
09/08/21, 10:56 pm - Raktim Dey: At first, 2020²=1(mod 3).
09/08/21, 10:56 pm - Nafisa: So split 12 right? Becoz splitting 2020 is of no use
09/08/21, 10:56 pm - Raktim Dey: So, 2020²⁰²⁰=1(mod 3).
09/08/21, 10:57 pm - Nafisa: :/
09/08/21, 10:57 pm - Raktim Dey: Iske baad, 4 wala part karna hoga.
09/08/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: But 2020 and 4 are not co prime?
09/08/21, 10:58 pm - Raktim Dey: It's not.
09/08/21, 10:58 pm - Raktim Dey: 2020=0(mod 4). 
So, 2020²⁰²⁰=0(mod 4).
09/08/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: Very smart
09/08/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: Got it
09/08/21, 10:59 pm - Raktim Dey: Since gcd(3,4)=1,
2020²⁰²⁰=1.0=0(mod 12).
09/08/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: Then we add them
09/08/21, 10:59 pm - Raktim Dey: Multiply.
09/08/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: No wait
09/08/21, 10:59 pm - Raktim Dey: Wait, I'll check the answer.
09/08/21, 11:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Sadly, answer is 4.
09/08/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: Ye 1 hain remainder?
09/08/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: Shayad 4 hain
09/08/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
09/08/21, 11:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Na na, it's 1.
09/08/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: :/
09/08/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: Choro
09/08/21, 11:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
09/08/21, 11:17 pm - Raktim Dey: 2020²=1(mod 3).
So, 2020²⁰¹⁸=1(mod 3).
Also, 2020=1(mod 3).
So, 2020²⁰¹⁹=1(mod 3).
2020=101×4×5.
101=1(mod 4), 5 =1(mod 4). So, 2020=0=4(mod 4). So, 2020²⁰²⁰=4×1=4(mod 3×4)=4(mod 12).
10/08/21, 6:53 am - Nafisa: Thanks bro
10/08/21, 7:23 pm - Raktim Dey: All the best for tomorrow.
10/08/21, 7:24 pm - Nafisa: Thank you
10/08/21, 7:24 pm - Nafisa: I just finished watching Dil chata hain
10/08/21, 7:24 pm - Raktim Dey: It's a great movie.
10/08/21, 7:24 pm - Nafisa: Wasted my time

14/08/21, 8:31 am - Nafisa: Achha
14/08/21, 12:56 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm trying to predict a lottery.
14/08/21, 12:58 pm - Raktim Dey: There's an online lottery in Kolkata, where they give out eight three digit numbers, and if you're right about any one of them, you win. I don't know the rules properly, but right now, I'm trying to predict one of the numbers based on the last five days' answers.
14/08/21, 12:59 pm - Raktim Dey: I have written down eight three digit numbers, and I have to check if any of them matches. I'm predicting using probability and my getting right about any one of the numbers is 2/225, which is a pretty slim chance.
14/08/21, 1:00 pm - Nafisa: Wow
14/08/21, 1:00 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
14/08/21, 1:00 pm - Nafisa: The most useful thing Math taught you.

14/08/21, 1:01 pm - Nafisa: :/
14/08/21, 1:01 pm - Raktim Dey: Aj raat ko hi pata chalega if it's correct.

14/08/21, 1:01 pm - Nafisa: Yay
14/08/21, 1:02 pm - Nafisa: Whats the reward?
14/08/21, 1:02 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't know. I'm not betting. I'm just in it for the maths. See if I'm right.
14/08/21, 1:04 pm - Nafisa: What?
14/08/21, 1:04 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
14/08/21, 1:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Wow. Okay.😂
14/08/21, 1:05 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>

14/08/21, 1:06 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
14/08/21, 1:06 pm - Raktim Dey: But I have to know if I'm right na. If I'm right one time, then probability suggests I'll be right the next time too.
14/08/21, 1:07 pm - Nafisa: Fine
14/08/21, 1:07 pm - Nafisa: Stubborn
14/08/21, 1:07 pm - Raktim Dey: Waisa nahi.😂

18/08/21, 8:30 pm - Nafisa: I promise
18/08/21, 8:31 pm - Raktim Dey: Arre, it's no big deal. Minerva is gonna come to Kolkata on Monday to get her marksheet and leave the same day. She's not gonna meet me. She told me this half an hour ago. So I was angry about it.
18/08/21, 8:32 pm - Raktim Dey: The funny thing is, I don't really want to meet her either, because if I saw her, I'd start feeling a lot of things that I've kept tightly inside. But I was still angry for some reason.
18/08/21, 8:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Anyway, I'm not angry anymore.
18/08/21, 8:33 pm - Nafisa: Understood
18/08/21, 8:33 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
18/08/21, 8:33 pm - Nafisa: Don't Suppress anything na
18/08/21, 8:34 pm - Nafisa: Whatever you have been holding tight, take it out, I'm not saying talk to me, do something which will take it out of you. You will feel much better I swear

19/08/21, 1:29 am - Nafisa: Usually four
19/08/21, 1:29 am - Raktim Dey: I can't eat more than three.
19/08/21, 1:29 am - Raktim Dey: I couldn't even eat the whole pizza and half garlic bread today.

19/08/21, 1:32 am - Nafisa: Its no more about the disease now
19/08/21, 1:33 am - Nafisa: Its all politics and business
19/08/21, 1:33 am - Raktim Dey: It was always about that.

19/08/21, 1:35 am - Raktim Dey: It's not good.😂
19/08/21, 1:35 am - Nafisa: Why?
19/08/21, 1:35 am - Nafisa: You can open up with me toh
19/08/21, 1:35 am - Nafisa: I don't judge
19/08/21, 1:35 am - Raktim Dey: I am always trying to not say what's on my mind. I'm always sugarcoating things.
19/08/21, 1:35 am - Raktim Dey: I know.
19/08/21, 1:36 am - Nafisa: You can try not doing it, start with me, we will work it out together
19/08/21, 1:37 am - Raktim Dey: I have, a few times, said some things unintentionally to some people which were rude and I hurt them. So I try my best to never intentionally hurt anyone.
19/08/21, 1:37 am - Raktim Dey: Things aren't good with Minerva. Sejuti doesn't talk with me now either.
19/08/21, 1:38 am - Nafisa: Don't worry
19/08/21, 1:38 am - Nafisa: Everything will be okay, give it sometime
19/08/21, 1:38 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah, maybe.
19/08/21, 1:39 am - Nafisa: With Minerva, it will take longer than we can imagine maybe, becoz things are different
19/08/21, 1:39 am - Raktim Dey: It won't get better with her.
19/08/21, 1:40 am - Nafisa: With Sej, she got disappointed with you, stick to her and it will be back to normal. She loves you as much as you do. Its just few things, here and there
19/08/21, 1:40 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I hope so.
19/08/21, 1:41 am - Nafisa: It can't get any worse too, and about better you don't know what future is waiting, I mean you can be friends again like normally in future
19/08/21, 1:41 am - Raktim Dey: I don't want to be friends.
19/08/21, 1:41 am - Nafisa: But you have to give her space and time
19/08/21, 1:42 am - Nafisa: There can't be more my dear. I'm so sorry, I know how much this hurts
19/08/21, 1:43 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah, well. It's all right now. It was worse even a month ago. Now I'm trying to get over everything.
19/08/21, 1:43 am - Nafisa: Thats not possible to happen in a day right? So work on it slowly
19/08/21, 1:43 am - Raktim Dey: All I can say for certain is, I'll never love anyone the way I loved her.
19/08/21, 1:44 am - Raktim Dey: We broke up more than a year ago. It's been too slow for me.
19/08/21, 1:45 am - Nafisa: It took me three years to get over a boy whom i didn't even date
19/08/21, 1:45 am - Raktim Dey: It happens. You never know how you're gonna fall for someone.
19/08/21, 1:45 am - Nafisa: Its not same for all, some takes days, some takes years, some takes forever and few feels forever
19/08/21, 1:46 am - Nafisa: Yes. But love is magical right? If its suffocating you, then I will say its not something called Love (my opinion)
19/08/21, 1:47 am - Nafisa: Love should not make you feel weak, it should make you feel complete, irrespective of what the person you feel for thinks of you
19/08/21, 1:47 am - Raktim Dey: I really don't want to talk about love right now.😂
19/08/21, 1:48 am - Nafisa: Okay sir. Notee
19/08/21, 1:48 am - Nafisa: Noted.
19/08/21, 1:48 am - Raktim Dey: But you can feel free to say anything you want.
19/08/21, 1:48 am - Nafisa: I have nothing. You should be the one saying
19/08/21, 1:48 am - Nafisa: You hide alot
19/08/21, 1:49 am - Raktim Dey: I do.
19/08/21, 1:49 am - Nafisa: Pretend too much
19/08/21, 1:49 am - Raktim Dey: I know.
19/08/21, 1:49 am - Nafisa: I don't like it
19/08/21, 1:49 am - Nafisa: But again I understand
19/08/21, 1:49 am - Raktim Dey: I'm not hiding because I don't want to talk about it with you. Sometimes it brings back bad memories.
19/08/21, 1:50 am - Nafisa: Yes Yes
19/08/21, 1:50 am - Nafisa: Completely fine
19/08/21, 1:50 am - Nafisa: Virtual tight hug
19/08/21, 1:50 am - Raktim Dey: Thanks.😂
19/08/21, 1:50 am - Nafisa: Paas hoti toh bohot tight sa hug deti tereko
19/08/21, 1:50 am - Raktim Dey: You know, my first instinct when I feel like I'm falling for someone is I become distant.
19/08/21, 1:51 am - Raktim Dey: I did this with Minerva too, when I realised.
19/08/21, 1:51 am - Nafisa: When?
19/08/21, 1:51 am - Raktim Dey: 2019.
19/08/21, 1:51 am - Nafisa: Then?
19/08/21, 1:51 am - Raktim Dey: Yes.
19/08/21, 1:51 am - Raktim Dey: I don't know why I did it with Akriti.
19/08/21, 1:52 am - Raktim Dey: She really liked me.
19/08/21, 1:52 am - Nafisa: She said so?
19/08/21, 1:52 am - Raktim Dey: I knew.
19/08/21, 1:52 am - Raktim Dey: From her messages.
19/08/21, 1:53 am - Raktim Dey: I have started talking with her now. I don't know why. I always felt I should apologise to her.
19/08/21, 1:53 am - Raktim Dey: I want to do that eventually I guess.
19/08/21, 1:54 am - Nafisa: Raktim ek baat dhyaan se sun, bura lagega but sun, untill and unless the person tells you she/he likes you, don't jump to conclusions,,,this made you far from Sej
19/08/21, 1:54 am - Nafisa: Do it.
19/08/21, 1:54 am - Raktim Dey: Why, the Meghna thing?
19/08/21, 1:54 am - Nafisa: Yes
19/08/21, 1:55 am - Nafisa: The Meghna thing was like the end point.
19/08/21, 1:55 am - Raktim Dey: But I didn't do anything offensive.
19/08/21, 1:55 am - Raktim Dey: Or hurtful.
19/08/21, 1:55 am - Raktim Dey: It's not like I joked about it or anything.
19/08/21, 1:55 am - Nafisa: She had chota mota few complaints which sorted out but when meghna thing happened she felt bad
19/08/21, 1:56 am - Nafisa: No you didn't but did you distant yourself from Meghna?
19/08/21, 1:56 am - Nafisa: Like ignorning her messages and all?
19/08/21, 1:56 am - Raktim Dey: I replied to all her messages.
19/08/21, 1:57 am - Raktim Dey: But kabhi kabhi late se
19/08/21, 1:57 am - Raktim Dey: .
19/08/21, 1:57 am - Nafisa: Maybe late?
19/08/21, 1:57 am - Nafisa: Haan
19/08/21, 1:57 am - Raktim Dey: I didn't know what else to do.
19/08/21, 1:57 am - Raktim Dey: I misunderstood and didn't want it to be awkward.
19/08/21, 1:57 am - Nafisa: Smart kid understood you avoiding her and it confused her alot
19/08/21, 1:57 am - Raktim Dey: Achha.
19/08/21, 1:57 am - Nafisa: And Meghna is a very sensitive person.
19/08/21, 1:58 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah. She deleted my contact.
19/08/21, 1:58 am - Nafisa: Yaad hain when you told me about Biswajit, how angry I got
19/08/21, 1:58 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
19/08/21, 1:58 am - Nafisa: So yeah
19/08/21, 1:59 am - Nafisa: Aesi baate logoko aesi lagti hain
19/08/21, 1:59 am - Nafisa: It hurts when you try to be friendly and someone misunderstands
19/08/21, 2:00 am - Nafisa: She had common interest with you so she used to get excited to tell you stuff
19/08/21, 2:00 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah. I liker talking with her too. But I misunderstood. That was my mistake.
19/08/21, 2:00 am - Raktim Dey: Anyway, I'll apologise to her.
19/08/21, 2:01 am - Nafisa: Haan, so even for Akriti, you never know, maybe she didn't like you the way you thought and then you just ghosted
19/08/21, 2:01 am - Raktim Dey: That was different. She liked me. She asked me out.
19/08/21, 2:01 am - Nafisa: Conclusion: don't jump to conclusions
19/08/21, 2:01 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
19/08/21, 2:03 am - Nafisa: I know something else Raktim. We were friends then, and once I heard you started talking to her, so they asked me if you were a nice guy or not. Maybe she did liked you but maybe not how much you were thinking,,,now even the amount matters.😂
19/08/21, 2:04 am - Raktim Dey: I didn't care about the amount or anything. I just knew that she liked me.
19/08/21, 2:04 am - Nafisa: And also they asked me if I was dating you, then when I said no, they told me about Akriti
19/08/21, 2:04 am - Raktim Dey: Whoa. Kab?
19/08/21, 2:04 am - Raktim Dey: Who is they?
19/08/21, 2:05 am - Nafisa: ''Really'', maybe not really and just liked you. I'm not trying to put you down bro, please don't get me wrong, I care enough for you to not do something stupid again
19/08/21, 2:06 am - Raktim Dey: No no, I got what you meant.
19/08/21, 2:06 am - Nafisa: Mayura, Rishika, ayesha, it was when I was in that group
19/08/21, 2:06 am - Raktim Dey: Achha.
19/08/21, 2:08 am - Nafisa: Did i make you feel worse?
19/08/21, 2:08 am - Nafisa: Be honest
19/08/21, 2:08 am - Raktim Dey: I don't know.
19/08/21, 2:09 am - Raktim Dey: But I needed to know this. So I'm glad you told me.
19/08/21, 2:09 am - Nafisa: I was waiting for it
19/08/21, 2:09 am - Nafisa: I was very scared of correcting you befoew
19/08/21, 2:09 am - Nafisa: Before*
19/08/21, 2:10 am - Nafisa: But now our friendship has gone one step ahead so yeah
19/08/21, 2:10 am - Nafisa: But i also know you won't ever tell me when I'm crossing the line, bro please do, please talk. It helps

19/08/21, 2:20 am - Nafisa: Angry bachhas
19/08/21, 2:20 am - Raktim Dey: She could have just told me herself.
19/08/21, 2:21 am - Nafisa: She won't, she don't wanna hurt you
19/08/21, 2:21 am - Raktim Dey: Well, she did.
19/08/21, 2:21 am - Nafisa: She is always so scared you will be hurt or something
19/08/21, 2:21 am - Nafisa: Sabka apna tareeka hota hain dosti main. Mera wala best hain
19/08/21, 2:21 am - Raktim Dey: That's why she ignored me when we met in college a year and a half later and hasn't talked with me since.
19/08/21, 2:21 am - Nafisa: 🌚
19/08/21, 2:22 am - Raktim Dey: True.
19/08/21, 2:22 am - Nafisa: Slap her tighly next time
19/08/21, 2:22 am - Nafisa: I will do wait
19/08/21, 2:22 am - Raktim Dey: Okay.
19/08/21, 2:22 am - Nafisa: We will go to her house and slap her and come
19/08/21, 2:23 am - Nafisa: Pata hain Ben ke saat things got magical becoz of this, we could come back after even having ugly fights
19/08/21, 2:23 am - Raktim Dey: That's actually very healthy.
19/08/21, 2:23 am - Nafisa: We used to fight alot, serious ones.
19/08/21, 2:23 am - Raktim Dey: I know.
19/08/21, 2:24 am - Nafisa: I'm a pro at fighting bro
19/08/21, 2:24 am - Nafisa: But then I like to clear stuffs out. Not always but mostly
19/08/21, 2:24 am - Raktim Dey: I avoid fights mostly.
19/08/21, 2:25 am - Nafisa: Don't
19/08/21, 2:25 am - Nafisa: Fight it or maybe have a discussion
19/08/21, 2:25 am - Nafisa: Atleast
19/08/21, 2:25 am - Raktim Dey: I probably only fought with you twice, over those exam stuffs.
19/08/21, 2:26 am - Raktim Dey: I always avoided fights with Minerva, which I shouldn't have.
19/08/21, 2:26 am - Nafisa: And didn't feel our bond stronger when we got back?
19/08/21, 2:26 am - Raktim Dey: Yes.
19/08/21, 2:26 am - Nafisa: Yeah
19/08/21, 2:27 am - Nafisa: Past is gone, we can't do anything but learn from it
19/08/21, 2:27 am - Raktim Dey: I know.
19/08/21, 2:28 am - Nafisa: Be angry with Sej and sort it out okay. Agar lamba kheecha, things can get ugly
19/08/21, 2:29 am - Nafisa: Not saying now but soon
19/08/21, 2:29 am - Nafisa: She has her own reasons behind all she did, you have yours, so know this
19/08/21, 2:29 am - Raktim Dey: I don't know what else I can tell her. I apologized to her so many times then.
19/08/21, 2:30 am - Nafisa: Its not about apologizing dear
19/08/21, 2:31 am - Raktim Dey: She doesn't want to talk with me.
19/08/21, 2:31 am - Nafisa: Its about knowing whats important for each other, maybe something you don't care is very special for her, so its the surity you need to give that next time her choice will be respected from your side which you always do but the unintentional ones also will be taken care of
19/08/21, 2:32 am - Nafisa: Becoz she is stupid
19/08/21, 2:32 am - Raktim Dey: I know.
19/08/21, 2:32 am - Nafisa: And right now she is actually veey worried about her entrances
19/08/21, 2:32 am - Nafisa: She doesn't come online at all
19/08/21, 2:32 am - Nafisa: Doesn't call me
19/08/21, 2:32 am - Raktim Dey: Achha.
19/08/21, 2:32 am - Nafisa: She is studying
19/08/21, 2:33 am - Nafisa: Kuch exam dena hain usko and she is studying mostly these days
19/08/21, 2:33 am - Nafisa: We do😂
19/08/21, 2:33 am - Raktim Dey: Achha. I'll talk to her later then.
19/08/21, 2:33 am - Nafisa: Haan
19/08/21, 2:33 am - Nafisa: Okay
19/08/21, 2:33 am - Nafisa: Whenever you feel its high time and enough is enough
19/08/21, 2:34 am - Nafisa: Otherwise later will never come
19/08/21, 2:34 am - Raktim Dey: Wo toh bohot pehle hi laga tha. I was kind of hurt by the way she ignored me in college.
19/08/21, 2:34 am - Nafisa: Haan
19/08/21, 2:34 am - Nafisa: Understandable
19/08/21, 2:34 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah.

19/08/21, 2:35 am - Nafisa: Wo mar gaya
19/08/21, 2:36 am - Raktim Dey: I don't remember the last time I heard an adult say this.

19/08/21, 2:37 am - Raktim Dey: Just kidding.
19/08/21, 2:38 am - Nafisa: You weren't kidding I know
19/08/21, 2:38 am - Nafisa: Even I feel alone
19/08/21, 2:38 am - Nafisa: Thats okay
19/08/21, 2:39 am - Raktim Dey: I just like to think of myself as alone at times.
19/08/21, 2:39 am - Raktim Dey: It's some kind of hurting myself.
19/08/21, 2:39 am - Nafisa: But why?
19/08/21, 2:39 am - Raktim Dey: I don't know.
19/08/21, 2:39 am - Nafisa: Tell me when you want to

19/08/21, 2:40 am - Raktim Dey: Bohot purana hai ye sab.
19/08/21, 2:40 am - Nafisa: Wait. This sounds not right, I know that you know
19/08/21, 2:41 am - Nafisa: Haan damaj
19/08/21, 2:41 am - Raktim Dey: I try not to get too attached to people.
19/08/21, 2:41 am - Nafisa: Samaj aa raha hain
19/08/21, 2:41 am - Nafisa: Its okay

19/08/21, 2:47 am - Nafisa: Meresaat jhut nahi. Thappad padega, seriously.
19/08/21, 2:47 am - Raktim Dey: Because you seem to get emotional about silly things in front of others. So naturally you have control over real things.
19/08/21, 2:47 am - Raktim Dey: Okay.😂
19/08/21, 2:47 am - Nafisa: Arey waah.

19/08/21, 10:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Are wahi, about Meghna. We weren't very close. And all I did was reply late. Then why would she be hurt by that so much. A lot of people reply to texts late sometime.
19/08/21, 10:33 pm - Raktim Dey: Anyway, I apologized to her but she hasn't replied anything. There's nothing more I can do about this.
19/08/21, 10:56 pm - Nafisa: Areyyy
19/08/21, 10:57 pm - Nafisa: Its not about you replying late, its the fact that she found out you were thinking she likes you, that hurt her
19/08/21, 10:57 pm - Raktim Dey: How did she find out?
19/08/21, 10:57 pm - Nafisa: You somewhere like yourself.
19/08/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: Samaj aa jata hain when people act weird
19/08/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: Specially aese types
19/08/21, 10:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Not unless someone told her.
19/08/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: Yes I told her
19/08/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: 😒
19/08/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: Why do you think so much
19/08/21, 10:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Because nobody can guess this.
19/08/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: Galti ki, upar se finding out reasons
19/08/21, 10:59 pm - Raktim Dey: What galti? It's a misunderstanding.
19/08/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: I swear to God. I didn't
19/08/21, 10:59 pm - Raktim Dey: I know.
19/08/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: Haan wahi
19/08/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: Itna lamba kiu keech raha hain?
19/08/21, 11:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Because it really wasn't a big deal.
19/08/21, 11:00 pm - Raktim Dey: It really wasn't.
19/08/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: You didn't like apologizing to her or she not replying to your apology?
19/08/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: Haan it really is not.
19/08/21, 11:00 pm - Raktim Dey: I talked to her properly most of the time. When she started complimenting me too much, I replied a bit late.
19/08/21, 11:00 pm - Raktim Dey: That was all.
19/08/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: Haan
19/08/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: Its okay
19/08/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: Our problem was never Meghna
19/08/21, 11:01 pm - Raktim Dey: The fact that Sejuti got angry or whatever about this.
19/08/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: Idk how to explain Raktim
19/08/21, 11:01 pm - Raktim Dey: It's okay.
19/08/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: Just becoz tumko lagta something is not a big deal, doesn't mean its not for someone else
19/08/21, 11:02 pm - Nafisa: And its not the Meghna thing alone, ofcourse, it wasn't such a huge thing
19/08/21, 11:02 pm - Nafisa: It was all that was happening
19/08/21, 11:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know.
19/08/21, 11:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Anyway, leave it.
19/08/21, 11:02 pm - Nafisa: And Meghna point was end for her
19/08/21, 11:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
19/08/21, 11:02 pm - Nafisa: Okay
19/08/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: Raktim ziada mat soch
19/08/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: Kuch nahi hua
19/08/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: Sej ne aaj merese baat nahi ki achhe se
19/08/21, 11:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Kyu?
19/08/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: I was doubtful why
19/08/21, 11:05 pm - Nafisa: I asked Ben
19/08/21, 11:05 pm - Nafisa: He said she seems okay to her
19/08/21, 11:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Meghna probably told her I said sorry to her. But I hope I didn't cause any problems.
19/08/21, 11:05 pm - Nafisa: But I guess uska kuch apan tension chal raha hain, which she is trying to handle herself only
19/08/21, 11:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
19/08/21, 11:06 pm - Raktim Dey: If I did, I'm sorry.
19/08/21, 11:06 pm - Nafisa: Abbe nahi yaar, agar Meghna dekhegi toh reply karegi
19/08/21, 11:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
19/08/21, 11:06 pm - Nafisa: What are you sorry for now?
19/08/21, 11:06 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't know.
19/08/21, 11:06 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm just so sick of everything right now.
19/08/21, 11:06 pm - Nafisa: Stop saying sorry when you yourself are doubtful that it was fault or not
19/08/21, 11:07 pm - Raktim Dey: I know.
19/08/21, 11:07 pm - Nafisa: Dikh raha hain
19/08/21, 11:07 pm - Nafisa: Bro, never do things for the sake of it. It makes it worse
19/08/21, 11:07 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
19/08/21, 11:08 pm - Raktim Dey: I went to run today when it was raining.
19/08/21, 11:08 pm - Raktim Dey: I just kept running till my legs hurt.
19/08/21, 11:09 pm - Nafisa: You don't have to run away
19/08/21, 11:09 pm - Nafisa: Its okay
19/08/21, 11:09 pm - Raktim Dey: I really want to.
19/08/21, 11:09 pm - Nafisa: You can do it, I will try to help
19/08/21, 11:09 pm - Nafisa: Sej ke saat kuch utna nahi hua jitna tum soch rahe ho
19/08/21, 11:09 pm - Nafisa: Its just a baby girl angry
19/08/21, 11:10 pm - Nafisa: Which will be better with two slaps and chocolate
19/08/21, 11:10 pm - Raktim Dey: Let's hope so.
19/08/21, 11:11 pm - Raktim Dey: I'll try talking to her again.
19/08/21, 11:11 pm - Nafisa: It will
19/08/21, 11:11 pm - Nafisa: Abhi wo busy hain padhai leke
19/08/21, 11:11 pm - Raktim Dey: I didn't mean right now.
19/08/21, 11:11 pm - Nafisa: Kisise baat nahi karti lambe time tak, not saying it to make you feel better
19/08/21, 11:11 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
19/08/21, 11:12 pm - Nafisa: Nono, I'm saying that don't feel she is ignorning you if she replies  late
19/08/21, 11:12 pm - Raktim Dey: No no, that I know.

19/08/21, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: Do you think it'll be different, saying "I love you" now after this? I mean isse pehle toh bola hoga, as friends.
19/08/21, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: I can see that.
19/08/21, 11:20 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm asking a lot of weird, uncomfortable questions.

19/08/21, 11:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Besides, everytime you talked about wanting a boyfriend jokingly, I always told you that it doesn't happen that way. It happens all of a sudden, when you're least expecting it. And it happened exactly that way.

22/08/21, 9:04 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't talk about Minerva with him. He asked me so many times, but I haven't.
22/08/21, 9:05 pm - Raktim Dey: I haven't talked about it with anyone.
22/08/21, 9:05 pm - Nafisa: Why

22/08/21, 9:16 pm - Nafisa: You will get calls every night
22/08/21, 9:17 pm - Nafisa: Yes you are

23/08/21, 1:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Hyderabad ka hall ticket nikal gaya.
23/08/21, 1:22 pm - Raktim Dey: https://online.uohyd.ac.in/LogUOH.aspx
23/08/21, 1:23 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't know if Sejuti applied here for stats. Agar kiya ho toh use bhi bol dena.
23/08/21, 1:41 pm - Nafisa: Okay
23/08/21, 1:45 pm - Nafisa: Aizawl
23/08/21, 1:45 pm - Nafisa: It is
23/08/21, 1:45 pm - Nafisa: I'm so happy
23/08/21, 2:00 pm - Raktim Dey: That's great.
23/08/21, 2:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Mera Belghoria me hain. Probably Debmalya ke area me.
23/08/21, 2:13 pm - Nafisa: All the best
23/08/21, 2:13 pm - Nafisa: Jayega dene?
23/08/21, 2:13 pm - Raktim Dey: Ha.
23/08/21, 5:20 pm - Raktim Dey: What did you tell her?
23/08/21, 5:21 pm - Raktim Dey: I was feeling bad yesterday about all that and that's why I told you. And now we were fighting.
23/08/21, 6:53 pm - Nafisa: I didn't tell her anything. When Sej heard about me and Ben she called and we were talking and I said I feel bad for you becoz Minerva can't meet you, then Sej said no, thats not what happened, then I asked Sej to ask Minerva if she stills wants to meet you becoz I felt as if you misunderstood her and will want to meet her and I was gonna scold you for lying to me/misinterupting Minerva, but again Sej said something like minerva had a talk and it seems you were upset , I didn't wanted to stress it anymore becoz Mg was already so tensed and you have your interview ahead.
23/08/21, 6:55 pm - Nafisa: Please say something
23/08/21, 6:55 pm - Nafisa: I'm sorry won't be enough I know
23/08/21, 6:55 pm - Raktim Dey: It's okay.
23/08/21, 6:55 pm - Nafisa: I know its not
23/08/21, 6:56 pm - Raktim Dey: It's not your fault, okay? I mean it.
23/08/21, 6:56 pm - Nafisa: I'm so sorry
23/08/21, 6:56 pm - Nafisa: I didn't know it would trigger her
23/08/21, 6:56 pm - Nafisa: Just wanted to help you guys meet and clear things
23/08/21, 6:57 pm - Raktim Dey: Nafisa, it's not your fault. Don't feel bad about it.
23/08/21, 6:57 pm - Nafisa: I was so angry at you yesterday, I should have spoke to you, toh ye nahi hota
23/08/21, 6:57 pm - Raktim Dey: Why were you angry at me?
23/08/21, 6:58 pm - Nafisa: I should have spoke to Minerva instead of Sej
23/08/21, 6:59 pm - Nafisa: Becoz you misunderstood her and was missing the chance to meet her which you were already upset about. There was a time I thought you lied but then I figured out it was misunderstanding
23/08/21, 6:59 pm - Nafisa: Raktim, I'm so sorry
23/08/21, 7:01 pm - Nafisa: Please send it, whatever you wrote
23/08/21, 7:01 pm - Raktim Dey: No. I deleted it. I don't want to create any more misunderstandings.
23/08/21, 7:01 pm - Nafisa: I promise it won't
23/08/21, 7:01 pm - Nafisa: Please
23/08/21, 7:02 pm - Nafisa: I know it feels like I broke your trust, but believe me I had no idea it will trigger her like this
23/08/21, 7:03 pm - Raktim Dey: When she told me that she's coming to Kolkata and won't have time for anything, I was angry and I told her because we wouldn't be able to meet. I didn't know when she's coming or leaving. She didn't even ask me if we wanted to meet. But somehow it's my fault now, that I didn't ask her to meet.
23/08/21, 7:03 pm - Nafisa: Its no one fault
23/08/21, 7:04 pm - Nafisa: Its a misunderstanding
23/08/21, 7:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Anyway, it doesn't matter.
23/08/21, 7:04 pm - Nafisa: She is having a very bad time. Maybe thats why the slighest thing triggers her
23/08/21, 7:04 pm - Nafisa: It does
23/08/21, 7:05 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't want to talk about Minerva anymore.
23/08/21, 7:05 pm - Nafisa: Okay
23/08/21, 7:06 pm - Nafisa: You wanna shot at me for anything
23/08/21, 7:06 pm - Nafisa: Please do
23/08/21, 7:06 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm not mad at you, Nafisa.
23/08/21, 7:06 pm - Nafisa: But I'm
23/08/21, 7:07 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm angry at other people. Not you.
23/08/21, 7:07 pm - Nafisa: Who?
23/08/21, 7:07 pm - Nafisa: Talk to her
23/08/21, 7:07 pm - Nafisa: Otherwise it won't be solved
23/08/21, 7:07 pm - Raktim Dey: I did. It didn't do any good.
23/08/21, 7:07 pm - Nafisa: Not talking about Mg
23/08/21, 7:08 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm not talking to her either.
23/08/21, 7:08 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm angry with both of them.
23/08/21, 7:08 pm - Nafisa: Its no one's fault
23/08/21, 7:08 pm - Nafisa: Trust me
23/08/21, 7:08 pm - Nafisa: Sej ka koi fault nahi hain
23/08/21, 7:08 pm - Raktim Dey: Somehow I'm ending up as the bad person everytime, and I didn't even know it was my fault.
23/08/21, 7:09 pm - Nafisa: You are not bad
23/08/21, 7:09 pm - Nafisa: You are not
23/08/21, 7:09 pm - Nafisa: If you were we would not stick to you
23/08/21, 7:09 pm - Raktim Dey: I know I'm not bad, but it feels that way sometime.
23/08/21, 7:09 pm - Nafisa: Minerva would have blocked you already
23/08/21, 7:09 pm - Nafisa: No
23/08/21, 7:09 pm - Nafisa: It was a misunderstanding
23/08/21, 7:10 pm - Nafisa: Sej me kuch nahi kiya
23/08/21, 7:10 pm - Nafisa: You both already have things going on
23/08/21, 7:10 pm - Nafisa: Yaar
23/08/21, 7:10 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know.
23/08/21, 7:10 pm - Nafisa: Sej ne kuch nahi kiya,  everyone misunderstood
23/08/21, 7:11 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm not blaming her.
23/08/21, 7:11 pm - Nafisa: She only told me tera interview hain and not to fight with you
23/08/21, 7:11 pm - Nafisa: But you are hurt
23/08/21, 7:11 pm - Nafisa: She is hurt too
23/08/21, 7:12 pm - Nafisa: And its all a fucking misunderstanding
23/08/21, 7:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
23/08/21, 7:12 pm - Raktim Dey: I'll talk with Sejuti soon and sort things out.
23/08/21, 7:13 pm - Nafisa: Yes
23/08/21, 7:13 pm - Nafisa: Kuch karna mat manme
23/08/21, 7:13 pm - Nafisa: The way you came to me said that thing, tell her also
23/08/21, 7:13 pm - Nafisa: Don't be scared of fighting with the ones you still care for
23/08/21, 7:14 pm - Nafisa: It always worth it.
23/08/21, 7:14 pm - Nafisa: It will hurt but long run you will atleast be clear you gave a shot
23/08/21, 7:14 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know. I'll talk it out with Sejuti.
23/08/21, 7:15 pm - Nafisa: Yes. High time
23/08/21, 7:15 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha, when did Minerva find out what I told you? Aj ya Kal?
23/08/21, 7:15 pm - Nafisa: Yesterday night
23/08/21, 7:16 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
23/08/21, 7:16 pm - Nafisa: Kya hua?
23/08/21, 7:16 pm - Nafisa: Feels like detective
23/08/21, 7:16 pm - Raktim Dey: She asked me just a few hours ago.
23/08/21, 7:16 pm - Nafisa: Haan
23/08/21, 7:17 pm - Nafisa: She couldn't keep it  inside
23/08/21, 7:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
23/08/21, 7:17 pm - Nafisa: Raktim
23/08/21, 7:18 pm - Nafisa: You won't trust me or anyone with sharing again na?
23/08/21, 7:18 pm - Nafisa: I know how you felt
23/08/21, 7:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Nafisa, I'm not mad at you.
23/08/21, 7:19 pm - Nafisa: I know
23/08/21, 7:21 pm - Raktim Dey: See, Minerva could have asked me last night only and we could have cleared it up then and could have met today. But she texted me this just a few hours ago after getting back from college, so it's obvious that she didn't want to meet me. I know you feel that it's your fault and it's a misunderstanding, but it's not your fault. Whatever happened, had to happen anyway. So it's fine.
23/08/21, 7:21 pm - Nafisa: No
23/08/21, 7:21 pm - Nafisa: OMG
23/08/21, 7:21 pm - Nafisa: Minerva wanted to meet you
23/08/21, 7:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Maybe she did.
23/08/21, 7:22 pm - Raktim Dey: It doesn't matter anymore.

11/09/21, 6:54 pm - Raktim Dey: Sir, 
My name is Nafisa Barlaskar. I'm a student of the mathematics department, my registration ID-_____.
I recently graduated from Xavier's and now I'm going to apply for a Masters degree. But unfortunately, I live in Aizawl and there's been an indefinite lockdown in my state because of rising covid cases. So I haven't been able to come to Kolkata to get my final marksheet. 
Under these circumstances, I'd like to request to send me a soft copy of my marksheet so I can apply to universities before the deadline expires. Thank you.
11/09/21, 6:55 pm - Nafisa: I will mention the deadline is 15th september?

02/10/21, 11:39 pm - Raktim Dey: For once, I thought ki 5th ko Mayurakshi ko aane bolu. But after she finds out about you two, if I go too, she might get a wrong idea or feel uncomfortable thinking of it as a date or something.
02/10/21, 11:39 pm - Nafisa: Nooo
02/10/21, 11:39 pm - Nafisa: Ben ke saath she is pretty close

02/10/21, 11:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
02/10/21, 11:41 pm - Nafisa: He will give you better ideas than me
02/10/21, 11:41 pm - Nafisa: 😂
02/10/21, 11:42 pm - Raktim Dey: That's what she said.
02/10/21, 11:42 pm - Nafisa: But you know

02/10/21, 11:42 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂
02/10/21, 11:42 pm - Nafisa: Becoz they got this wrong idea with Akriti
02/10/21, 11:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Matlab?
02/10/21, 11:43 pm - Nafisa: Told you na
02/10/21, 11:43 pm - Nafisa: When you were talking with Akriti they thought maybe you are interested but you said she was the one who started convo
02/10/21, 11:43 pm - Raktim Dey: That was different.
02/10/21, 11:44 pm - Nafisa: But Mayura ke saat different ho sakta hain
02/10/21, 11:44 pm - Nafisa: Haan
02/10/21, 11:44 pm - Nafisa: That only
02/10/21, 11:44 pm - Raktim Dey: It is different.
02/10/21, 11:44 pm - Nafisa: Did you feel that she feels like that?
02/10/21, 11:45 pm - Raktim Dey: See, I like Mayurakshi. I like spending time with her, and she seems to have fun too. So that's not the problem. I have thought a few times about you know, asking her out. But I can't.
02/10/21, 11:45 pm - Nafisa: Now I see
02/10/21, 11:45 pm - Nafisa: Chutiya phele nahi bola mereko
02/10/21, 11:46 pm - Nafisa: When we met on 1st, I could see on your face something was bothering you and you wanted to discuss it
02/10/21, 11:46 pm - Nafisa: Why can't bro? Tell me
02/10/21, 11:46 pm - Raktim Dey: This isn't bothering me, really. I know what I'm doing. Sometimes I get confused, but that's all.
02/10/21, 11:47 pm - Nafisa: Chal chal
02/10/21, 11:47 pm - Nafisa: What confusion?
02/10/21, 11:47 pm - Raktim Dey: The thing is, I like Mayurakshi. She's a good friend. I like talking with her. Even in the best case scenario, even if she feels the same, I don't want to end up hurting her.
02/10/21, 11:48 pm - Nafisa: Why do you think you will hurt her?
02/10/21, 11:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Because even in the best case scenario, I won't be able to fall in love with her, or anyone else.
02/10/21, 11:49 pm - Nafisa: Minerva?
02/10/21, 11:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
02/10/21, 11:49 pm - Raktim Dey: But let's not talk about that.
02/10/21, 11:49 pm - Nafisa: Okay
02/10/21, 11:49 pm - Nafisa: See do not ask her out if you are confused
02/10/21, 11:49 pm - Nafisa: Just let it be how it is
02/10/21, 11:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
02/10/21, 11:49 pm - Nafisa: Yeap
02/10/21, 11:50 pm - Raktim Dey: That's why I've never really asked her out, or said anything romantic ever.
02/10/21, 11:50 pm - Nafisa: Haan don't do that
02/10/21, 11:50 pm - Nafisa: Becoz you aren't really over someone else
02/10/21, 11:50 pm - Nafisa: And if this leads her on, then she might ne hurt
02/10/21, 11:51 pm - Nafisa: be*
02/10/21, 11:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know.
02/10/21, 11:51 pm - Nafisa: Yes
02/10/21, 11:51 pm - Nafisa: Just be friends but do not overthink
02/10/21, 11:51 pm - Raktim Dey: I'll keep things the way they are. Kabhi kabhi ghumne jana, that's all.
02/10/21, 11:51 pm - Nafisa: No need it to be thats all
02/10/21, 11:52 pm - Nafisa: With friends we are free to hang out or not, the bond is important
02/10/21, 11:52 pm - Nafisa: So maybe you can make a true friend
02/10/21, 11:52 pm - Nafisa: Than dekha jayega kya hoga
02/10/21, 11:52 pm - Raktim Dey: Ha, wahi.
02/10/21, 11:53 pm - Nafisa: But if you are over someone, do not get involve romantically with anyone else, this confusion will create a mess
02/10/21, 11:53 pm - Nafisa: Not*
02/10/21, 11:54 pm - Raktim Dey: It's not about being over her.
02/10/21, 11:54 pm - Raktim Dey: I know I won't be over her. I've accepted it.
02/10/21, 11:54 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm just trying to not think about it.
02/10/21, 11:55 pm - Nafisa: Then how will you move on if you suppress it?
02/10/21, 11:55 pm - Raktim Dey: "If you love one person, just one, with all your heart, then there's redemption in life. Even if you don't get to be with her. "
02/10/21, 11:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Murakami.
02/10/21, 11:56 pm - Nafisa: Okay
02/10/21, 11:56 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
02/10/21, 11:56 pm - Nafisa: But thats practically very difficult for you
02/10/21, 11:56 pm - Raktim Dey: I know.
02/10/21, 11:56 pm - Nafisa: Becoz you seem not happy with it
02/10/21, 11:56 pm - Raktim Dey: I try not to think about it.
02/10/21, 11:57 pm - Nafisa: Don't do that,bottling emotions do not help
02/10/21, 11:57 pm - Raktim Dey: What else is there to do? We don't talk anymore.
02/10/21, 11:58 pm - Nafisa: Yes, this is a space you both need
02/10/21, 11:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Anyway, doesn't matter.
02/10/21, 11:59 pm - Nafisa: I have had heard about the fights, now don't ask who told we are good friends, she didn't i found it out
02/10/21, 11:59 pm - Raktim Dey: It's okay.
02/10/21, 11:59 pm - Nafisa: So after all that, I guess a cut ofd from each other will be good
02/10/21, 11:59 pm - Nafisa: You have to think about it Raktim
02/10/21, 11:59 pm - Nafisa: This attitude doesn't help
03/10/21, 12:00 am - Nafisa: It will just kill you from inside and you will burst one day and I fear it will be bad.
03/10/21, 12:01 am - Raktim Dey: I don't really have an option.
03/10/21, 12:02 am - Nafisa: This is an option which u havr been ignoring
03/10/21, 12:02 am - Raktim Dey: I'm just trying not to think about her, and live my life. If I stop and start thinking again, I'll feel bad again.
03/10/21, 12:02 am - Nafisa: You have to do something about it to move on
03/10/21, 12:02 am - Raktim Dey: Next year shayad Chennai jaunga, do saal baad hopefully job milega. Maybe I will move on.
03/10/21, 12:02 am - Nafisa: Suppressing it won't help
03/10/21, 12:02 am - Raktim Dey: Hopefully I will.
03/10/21, 12:03 am - Nafisa: When you suppress, london doesn't help
03/10/21, 12:03 am - Nafisa: Chennai toh phir bhi paas hain
03/10/21, 12:03 am - Raktim Dey: What do I do, start screaming and crying about how much I miss Minerva? What good will that do?
03/10/21, 12:03 am - Raktim Dey: Maybe someday I'll eventually move on.
03/10/21, 12:04 am - Nafisa: Darling 1st ko kiu nahi baat kiya meresaat ye sab
03/10/21, 12:04 am - Nafisa: Crying helps
03/10/21, 12:04 am - Raktim Dey: I've cried a lot over this.
03/10/21, 12:04 am - Nafisa: Its a way to let out emotions
03/10/21, 12:04 am - Nafisa: With whom? Alone?
03/10/21, 12:05 am - Raktim Dey: A few times. Sometimes with Minerva over phone. Bohot pehle.
03/10/21, 12:05 am - Nafisa: I understand
03/10/21, 12:05 am - Raktim Dey: Okay.
03/10/21, 12:06 am - Nafisa: But not thinking about it now won't help
03/10/21, 12:07 am - Raktim Dey: This isn't something jiske baare me baat karne se sab thik ho jayega. This is gonna stay with me for a while. So I'm just keeping it aside for now.
03/10/21, 12:07 am - Raktim Dey: It was more than just a relationship.
03/10/21, 12:07 am - Nafisa: I know
03/10/21, 12:07 am - Raktim Dey: Okay.

07/10/21, 10:42 pm - Raktim Dey: It wasn't much. I was just asking how she is, etc. But she just seems so cold. I kind of feel sick. I shouldn't have tried to talk. It's never a good idea.
07/10/21, 10:44 pm - Raktim Dey: I get angry and feel sad at the same time. This happens every time I try talking with her. I wouldn't have, but I thought I should tell her about Hyderabad. Otherwise I wouldn't have.

07/10/21, 10:46 pm - Nafisa: Calm down

07/10/21, 10:47 pm - Nafisa: Now you said it
07/10/21, 10:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
07/10/21, 10:47 pm - Nafisa: Yes, i understand
07/10/21, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Sometimes I feel like she wants me to hate her.
07/10/21, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: I know she doesn't, but it feels that way sometimes.
07/10/21, 10:48 pm - Nafisa: She wants a break
07/10/21, 10:48 pm - Nafisa: Thats it
07/10/21, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
07/10/21, 10:49 pm - Nafisa: If you can get over her, which seems impossible to you, it will be peaceful for you
07/10/21, 10:49 pm - Nafisa: You will feel light
07/10/21, 10:49 pm - Raktim Dey: I know. I want to do that.
07/10/21, 10:49 pm - Nafisa: It starts from accepting the whole of the emotions you feel
07/10/21, 10:50 pm - Nafisa: Without running away
07/10/21, 10:50 pm - Raktim Dey: I'll get over her eventually.
07/10/21, 10:50 pm - Nafisa: Yes but if you want to
07/10/21, 10:50 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't feel the way I used to even a few months ago.
07/10/21, 10:50 pm - Raktim Dey: I'll get over her. I have to.
07/10/21, 10:50 pm - Nafisa: Nono
07/10/21, 10:51 pm - Nafisa: Its not something you will force yourself to
07/10/21, 10:51 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't care anymore. I just want to be over this.
07/10/21, 10:52 pm - Raktim Dey: I won't text her again.
07/10/21, 10:52 pm - Raktim Dey: That will help.
07/10/21, 10:52 pm - Nafisa: Yesss
07/10/21, 10:53 pm - Nafisa: But be careful of not supressing anything okay? Otherwise it will come back in future and it will be worse
07/10/21, 10:53 pm - Nafisa: Like today you told me what you felt, you can try everytime you think about her
07/10/21, 10:53 pm - Nafisa: Raktim, I know how hard it is
07/10/21, 10:53 pm - Raktim Dey: That won't work, because I think about her a lot more than you would think.
07/10/21, 10:53 pm - Nafisa: I have seen Ben go through it, I myself have been through this
07/10/21, 10:54 pm - Nafisa: Getting over people and not getting back love is the worse one can face

07/10/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: I came back and cried
07/10/21, 10:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Why?
07/10/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: Everything felt so overwhelming suddenly
07/10/21, 10:58 pm - Nafisa: So many thoughts acrossed

07/10/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: Aweee😂
07/10/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: But if you would be angry also I would take it
07/10/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: I deserved it
07/10/21, 11:01 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, but I wasn't.
07/10/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: Angel na you are
07/10/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: Angels are always calm
07/10/21, 11:01 pm - Raktim Dey: I try, but  sometimes I do get angry.

07/10/21, 11:02 pm - Nafisa: Obviously
07/10/21, 11:02 pm - Nafisa: Feeling all your emotions is important

07/10/21, 11:11 pm - Nafisa: You will feel at ease
07/10/21, 11:11 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
07/10/21, 11:11 pm - Nafisa: You often pretend alot
07/10/21, 11:11 pm - Nafisa: Trying to convince yourself
07/10/21, 11:11 pm - Raktim Dey: All the time.

11/10/21, 10:46 pm - Nafisa: So tell her okay, don't force yourself next time
11/10/21, 10:46 pm - Raktim Dey: I suggested pizza because I know she likes it. 😂

11/10/21, 10:48 pm - Raktim Dey: I generally just go to restaurants I prefer. But maybe sometimes it's better to go to places others like too. So I'm trying to change that.
11/10/21, 10:48 pm - Nafisa: Haan but you can have what you like
11/10/21, 10:48 pm - Nafisa: Dominos is not a restuarant
11/10/21, 10:48 pm - Nafisa: Its just Dominos
11/10/21, 10:49 pm - Raktim Dey: I know.
11/10/21, 10:49 pm - Nafisa: Going once in a while is okay
11/10/21, 10:49 pm - Nafisa: Do not justify now
11/10/21, 10:49 pm - Nafisa: Its nice you thought of her, but don't forget yourself in the process
11/10/21, 10:49 pm - Nafisa: We mostly make this mistake
11/10/21, 10:50 pm - Raktim Dey: I never did. But maybe that was a mistake too.
11/10/21, 10:50 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm trying to change a lot of little things about myself.
11/10/21, 10:50 pm - Nafisa: Aweee
11/10/21, 10:51 pm - Nafisa: Ok
11/10/21, 10:51 pm - Nafisa: Got it
11/10/21, 10:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Pehle, if I went out with someone, I was almost always late. That was not good. So now I'm always early.
11/10/21, 10:51 pm - Nafisa: There is something like always on time
11/10/21, 10:51 pm - Nafisa: You can try that
11/10/21, 10:51 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
11/10/21, 10:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
11/10/21, 10:52 pm - Nafisa: I understand the change you are trying

11/10/21, 10:52 pm - Nafisa: Its nice
11/10/21, 10:52 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
11/10/21, 10:52 pm - Nafisa: But there is a limit
11/10/21, 10:53 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm not gonna cross that, hopefully.
11/10/21, 10:53 pm - Raktim Dey: Besides, Mayurakshi and I are just friends. So it won't go too far hopefully.
11/10/21, 10:53 pm - Nafisa: Traffic police is here😂
11/10/21, 10:53 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂😂
11/10/21, 10:53 pm - Nafisa: Haan haan

11/10/21, 10:54 pm - Nafisa: I do it less now
11/10/21, 10:55 pm - Nafisa: Just why I kind of got scared when you had pizza again
11/10/21, 10:55 pm - Nafisa: But I know your case is different and its good
11/10/21, 10:55 pm - Nafisa: Try change
11/10/21, 10:55 pm - Nafisa: Its nice
11/10/21, 10:55 pm - Raktim Dey: Today wasn't that good. It was very crowded, it was hot. I thought Mayurakshi didn't have a good time, so I thought maybe she'll like pizza.
11/10/21, 10:56 pm - Nafisa: Aayyy
11/10/21, 10:56 pm - Nafisa: Thats why I prefered your house
11/10/21, 10:56 pm - Nafisa: I hate people
11/10/21, 10:56 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know.

08/11/21, 8:35 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
08/11/21, 8:35 pm - Nafisa: How to proof (Z,-) is a groupoid? Only binary will satisfy particularly ?
08/11/21, 8:36 pm - Raktim Dey: Groupoid matlab closure, associativity and identity.
08/11/21, 8:36 pm - Nafisa: No?
08/11/21, 8:36 pm - Raktim Dey: Z, - or Z, +?
08/11/21, 8:36 pm - Nafisa: Groupoid matlab closure only
08/11/21, 8:37 pm - Nafisa: - wala
08/11/21, 8:37 pm - Nafisa: + is semi
08/11/21, 8:37 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh. Phir toh hoga hi.
08/11/21, 8:37 pm - Raktim Dey: a, b integer hone se a-b is also an integer.

08/11/21, 8:39 pm - Raktim Dey: Exactly.
08/11/21, 8:39 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
08/11/21, 8:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
08/11/21, 8:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Sirf associativity fulfil nahi karega. So it's a groupoid.
08/11/21, 8:40 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
08/11/21, 8:41 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes. Basically associativity nahi hone se groupoid hi rahega.
08/11/21, 8:41 pm - Raktim Dey: You don't need to check anything after that.
08/11/21, 8:41 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
08/11/21, 8:41 pm - Nafisa: I know silly question
08/11/21, 8:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Ha. You're right. Identity satisfy nahi karega. Sab self invertible ho sakta hain. a-a=0.
08/11/21, 8:43 pm - Nafisa: Very good
08/11/21, 8:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Phir toh identity bhi hoga 0.
08/11/21, 8:44 pm - Raktim Dey: No no.
08/11/21, 8:44 pm - Nafisa: 🙂
08/11/21, 8:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Identity nahi hoga.
08/11/21, 8:44 pm - Nafisa: NO
08/11/21, 8:44 pm - Raktim Dey: That's why you can't say ki inverse hoga.
08/11/21, 8:44 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
08/11/21, 8:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Inverse doesn't exist without identity.
08/11/21, 8:44 pm - Nafisa: But all are self invertible
08/11/21, 8:45 pm - Raktim Dey: If we assume 0 is identity, which it isn't.
08/11/21, 8:45 pm - Nafisa: And for 2 left identity don't exist
08/11/21, 8:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
08/11/21, 8:45 pm - Nafisa: O
08/11/21, 8:45 pm - Nafisa: Nahi hain?
08/11/21, 8:45 pm - Nafisa: I thought 0 was the identity
08/11/21, 8:45 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
08/11/21, 8:48 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
08/11/21, 8:49 pm - Nafisa: Ok choro this is too silly

08/11/21, 8:51 pm - Nafisa: Haan
08/11/21, 8:51 pm - Nafisa: Maa hi nahi hogi toh bachha kaha se ayega type
08/11/21, 8:52 pm - Nafisa: My brain working extra slow today
08/11/21, 8:52 pm - Raktim Dey: Somehow, that makes sense.
08/11/21, 8:52 pm - Raktim Dey: Class shuru hua na.
08/11/21, 8:53 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
08/11/21, 8:53 pm - Nafisa: 🙂
08/11/21, 8:54 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm not sure which part the compliment is. 😂😂

11/11/21, 2:11 pm - Nafisa: And our great uni didn't give a choice
11/11/21, 2:11 pm - Nafisa: So we are all writing an application, but idk which one is more professional
11/11/21, 2:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Discrete maths will be needed in your course later, I think. Mera aur Ben ka bhi hain next sem me.
11/11/21, 2:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Computer architecture is about computer hardware.
11/11/21, 2:12 pm - Raktim Dey: Matlab names of the parts of a CPU and how they're attached to each other, etc.
11/11/21, 2:13 pm - Nafisa: Haan
11/11/21, 2:13 pm - Nafisa: Useless
11/11/21, 2:14 pm - Raktim Dey: Dekho application likhne ke baad kya bolte hain. Maths would be better and easier for you.
11/11/21, 2:14 pm - Nafisa: I know
11/11/21, 2:14 pm - Nafisa: But stupid classmates
11/11/21, 2:14 pm - Nafisa: 😭😭

11/11/21, 2:21 pm - Raktim Dey: See, at a very basic level, you knew you had to study most of it by yourself. You did that in BSc.

11/11/21, 2:22 pm - Nafisa: I was happy for the course. I was like atleast course is of my choice

13/11/21, 9:22 pm - Nafisa: Both
13/11/21, 9:23 pm - Raktim Dey: I can't do the process, because the upper limit is not infinity.
13/11/21, 9:23 pm - Nafisa: Answer is given to be xe^-x2
13/11/21, 9:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Differentiate karo. e^-x² a raha hain?

13/11/21, 10:55 pm - Raktim Dey: God, ghosts?
13/11/21, 10:55 pm - Nafisa: Yes
13/11/21, 10:56 pm - Raktim Dey: Biswajit aj Sikkim se wapas aya. He told me about something that happened there.
13/11/21, 10:56 pm - Nafisa: If ghost save it for tomorrow

13/11/21, 10:56 pm - Nafisa: Ok
13/11/21, 10:56 pm - Raktim Dey: Just something unexplainable.
13/11/21, 10:56 pm - Nafisa: Then say
13/11/21, 10:56 pm - Nafisa: Bolo bolo
13/11/21, 10:58 pm - Raktim Dey: He went to Sikkim with that friend, Shruti. So in Kalimpong, there's an old bungalow that belonged to Rabindranath Tagore. They went there. There was certain part in that house, behind some railing, jaha pe everytime they took a picture on their phones, it didn't get saved. They took pictures outside but they were saved, but not one single picture that they took inside that particular room didn't get saved.
13/11/21, 10:58 pm - Raktim Dey: As if that place can't be photographed.
13/11/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: Not ghost then you say this
13/11/21, 10:59 pm - Nafisa: 🙂
13/11/21, 10:59 pm - Raktim Dey: Ite not ghost.
13/11/21, 10:59 pm - Raktim Dey: It's*
13/11/21, 10:59 pm - Raktim Dey: It's just something that doesn't have a rational explanation.
13/11/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: Maybe they need adorable people like me
13/11/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: I will try next time
13/11/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: Waise bhi biswajit ka shakal hain
13/11/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: What can you expect
13/11/21, 11:00 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂😂😂😂😂😂

13/11/21, 11:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Wow.
13/11/21, 11:00 pm - Raktim Dey: Didn't expect that.
13/11/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: 🌚
13/11/21, 11:01 pm - Raktim Dey: Good one. 😂
13/11/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: Rational explanation

13/11/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
13/11/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: Anyways how was the place?
13/11/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: Spooky or calm?
13/11/21, 11:01 pm - Raktim Dey: He said it was great. The whole trip.
13/11/21, 11:01 pm - Raktim Dey: Calm. Nobody else was there in that building apart from the two of them.
13/11/21, 11:02 pm - Nafisa: Wow
13/11/21, 11:02 pm - Nafisa: Sounds romantic too
13/11/21, 11:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, but it wasn't like that.
13/11/21, 11:02 pm - Nafisa: For him, hope his coffee date went along
13/11/21, 11:02 pm - Raktim Dey: I thought it would be.
13/11/21, 11:03 pm - Raktim Dey: His date was here.
13/11/21, 11:03 pm - Nafisa: Wow
13/11/21, 11:03 pm - Nafisa: Now this is more interesting
13/11/21, 11:03 pm - Raktim Dey: What?
13/11/21, 11:03 pm - Nafisa: Biswajit had a date and not romantic
13/11/21, 11:03 pm - Raktim Dey: He likes this girl. The date, not Shruti.
13/11/21, 11:03 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
13/11/21, 11:03 pm - Nafisa: I know
13/11/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: That day when he told about shruti I saw he doesn't like her that way
13/11/21, 11:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. But I thought that if they went to a trip together, they're compatible.
13/11/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: Aesa nahi hota
13/11/21, 11:04 pm - Raktim Dey: And Shruti is nice.
13/11/21, 11:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, seems so.
13/11/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: Haan
13/11/21, 11:05 pm - Nafisa: Compatible people can turn out to be good friends but no romance
13/11/21, 11:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know that. I just hoped they'd end up together or something. They seem nice together. 😂
13/11/21, 11:05 pm - Nafisa: Arey re
13/11/21, 11:05 pm - Nafisa: 🌚
13/11/21, 11:06 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
13/11/21, 11:06 pm - Nafisa: If she don't like politics it seems difficult
13/11/21, 11:06 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
13/11/21, 11:06 pm - Raktim Dey: She does.😂
13/11/21, 11:06 pm - Nafisa: Wow
13/11/21, 11:06 pm - Raktim Dey: But she has a boyfriend I think.

25/11/21, 11:54 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't know. Didn't ask.
25/11/21, 11:54 pm - Nafisa: Achha
25/11/21, 11:54 pm - Nafisa: Let it be now
25/11/21, 11:54 pm - Nafisa: Let her get well
25/11/21, 11:54 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, it's fine.
25/11/21, 11:55 pm - Nafisa: Yeap
25/11/21, 11:55 pm - Nafisa: How are you?
25/11/21, 11:55 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm all right. Just too much padhai ka pressure.
25/11/21, 11:55 pm - Raktim Dey: You?
25/11/21, 11:56 pm - Nafisa: I am okay
25/11/21, 11:56 pm - Nafisa: Just adulthood ka pressure
25/11/21, 11:57 pm - Raktim Dey: How?
25/11/21, 11:57 pm - Nafisa: Idk
25/11/21, 11:57 pm - Nafisa: I don't like it
25/11/21, 11:57 pm - Nafisa: I was good young
25/11/21, 11:57 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, we all were. Tab sab bolte the, ki it's no fun growing up. Didn't believe then.
25/11/21, 11:58 pm - Nafisa: Yeah
25/11/21, 11:58 pm - Nafisa: 😭
25/11/21, 11:58 pm - Nafisa: Now i tell my sister
25/11/21, 11:58 pm - Nafisa: And she ignores me
25/11/21, 11:58 pm - Raktim Dey: Nobody believes this unless they experience itm
25/11/21, 11:58 pm - Raktim Dey: It.
25/11/21, 11:58 pm - Nafisa: Yeap
25/11/21, 11:59 pm - Nafisa: Ok Goodnight❤️✨
26/11/21, 12:00 am - Raktim Dey: Bye.
27/11/21, 4:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Do you think this is stupid?
27/11/21, 4:03 pm - Raktim Dey: We get four or five assignments every week, and sometimes there are internship tests. I do all my assignments on my own, and so don't get much time to prepare for internships. Rishika takes assignments from me, and studies for internships. She was shortlisted for an internship and I wasn't.
27/11/21, 4:04 pm - Raktim Dey: Once I wrote it, I realised it is stupid.
27/11/21, 4:08 pm - Nafisa: You wrote it to her?
27/11/21, 4:08 pm - Raktim Dey: No. To you.
27/11/21, 4:09 pm - Raktim Dey: .
27/11/21, 4:10 pm - Raktim Dey: I meant whether still giving her my assignments is stupid. It probably is.
27/11/21, 4:14 pm - Nafisa: For sure it is
27/11/21, 4:14 pm - Nafisa: Typing here anything stupid is not stupid ok
27/11/21, 4:14 pm - Nafisa: Thats what friends are for
27/11/21, 4:14 pm - Nafisa: Even I would be pissed
27/11/21, 4:14 pm - Raktim Dey: I didn't mean typing is stupid.
27/11/21, 4:15 pm - Raktim Dey: I meant whether sending the assignments are stupid.
27/11/21, 4:15 pm - Nafisa: Thinking is never stupid
27/11/21, 4:15 pm - Nafisa: Ofcourseee
27/11/21, 4:15 pm - Nafisa: Rn
27/11/21, 4:15 pm - Nafisa: When she is using yours
27/11/21, 4:15 pm - Nafisa: She is finding her way out you find yours
27/11/21, 4:15 pm - Nafisa: Now
27/11/21, 4:15 pm - Raktim Dey: She does help me sometimes, but it's mostly the other way around.
27/11/21, 4:15 pm - Nafisa: Like?
27/11/21, 4:16 pm - Raktim Dey: Matlab she asks for my assignments. I send her. If there's any mistake, she tells me.
27/11/21, 4:16 pm - Raktim Dey: While she's copying mine.
27/11/21, 4:21 pm - Nafisa: Oh!
27/11/21, 4:22 pm - Nafisa: Why are u focusing on studies now
27/11/21, 4:22 pm - Nafisa: Focus on internships na
27/11/21, 4:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
27/11/21, 4:22 pm - Nafisa: You join with and do the assignements together
27/11/21, 4:22 pm - Nafisa: She will surely agree to it
27/11/21, 4:22 pm - Nafisa: See playing smart is important here
27/11/21, 4:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I will. Still waiting for internships. Ab tak nahi mila.
27/11/21, 4:23 pm - Nafisa: If u do your assignements with her dividing works, you get time for internship preparations
27/11/21, 4:23 pm - Nafisa: Don't worry
27/11/21, 4:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know.
27/11/21, 4:23 pm - Nafisa: You ask her to do some and then tell her u will send the rest
27/11/21, 4:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I'll do that next time we get internships.
27/11/21, 4:24 pm - Nafisa: She can be trusted
27/11/21, 4:24 pm - Nafisa: Ofcourse do it always
27/11/21, 4:24 pm - Nafisa: And focus on internships
27/11/21, 4:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, she's nice to me generally. She will help if I ask. But I never ask.
27/11/21, 4:24 pm - Nafisa: Passing in average marks  won't matter if u get placed
27/11/21, 4:25 pm - Nafisa: 🤦‍♀️
27/11/21, 4:25 pm - Nafisa: Ask
27/11/21, 4:25 pm - Nafisa: Make use of her like she does
27/11/21, 4:25 pm - Nafisa: And I tell u she is trust worthy when it comes to team work
27/11/21, 4:25 pm - Nafisa: She is very co-operative
27/11/21, 4:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. I'll do that from next time.
27/11/21, 4:27 pm - Nafisa: Good boy
27/11/21, 4:27 pm - Nafisa: 😘😘❤️
27/11/21, 4:28 pm - Raktim Dey: Thanks. 😂
27/11/21, 4:30 pm - Nafisa: Yeah
27/11/21, 4:30 pm - Nafisa: Even in exams take help, study less and work on skills
27/11/21, 4:30 pm - Nafisa: I know its not your thing
27/11/21, 4:30 pm - Nafisa: But yeah
27/11/21, 4:30 pm - Nafisa: Everyone will be doing so you have to find a way
27/11/21, 4:30 pm - Raktim Dey: I probably can't do that in exams. But assignments me I will.
27/11/21, 4:31 pm - Nafisa: Okok

02/12/21, 12:43 pm - Raktim Dey: I deleted her number. But then saved it again for her annoying posts. 😂
02/12/21, 12:43 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
02/12/21, 12:43 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
02/12/21, 12:43 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂
02/12/21, 12:43 pm - Nafisa: Delete again

02/12/21, 12:44 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I will. 😂
02/12/21, 12:44 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
02/12/21, 12:44 pm - Nafisa: You know
02/12/21, 12:44 pm - Nafisa: My day started so bad
02/12/21, 12:45 pm - Raktim Dey: What happened?
02/12/21, 12:45 pm - Nafisa: I mailed my teacher two days back two things to check, she did , well and good
02/12/21, 12:46 pm - Nafisa: Yesterday I spent two hours in another thing but still wasn't sure about it so I asked her if i could mail her. She said yes and so I did
02/12/21, 12:47 pm - Nafisa: She clears the doubt in class, today before opening my file, she said Nafisa its not right u just write the algorithm and not go through it and send it to Ma'am for checking, u should try going through it before u send me
02/12/21, 12:47 pm - Nafisa: Now who will tell her I spend two hours on it
02/12/21, 12:48 pm - Nafisa: I found it very rude, idk why, felt like how GT used to treat when I went to him for doubts
02/12/21, 12:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, it's kind of crappy to be misunderstood by teachers that way.
02/12/21, 12:49 pm - Nafisa: Ironically she says one dialogue, you should always ask all your doubts, big or small
02/12/21, 12:50 pm - Raktim Dey: Sometimes they think all students are same. If one is not studying, then others aren't too. That's stupid of them.
02/12/21, 12:50 pm - Raktim Dey: I guess exam ke time me she'll understand you studied harder.
02/12/21, 12:50 pm - Nafisa: Lets see
02/12/21, 12:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Or I can mail her and confront her if you want. 😂
02/12/21, 12:51 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣

03/12/21, 4:53 pm - Raktim Dey: Hamare batch ka chemistry department ka ek ladke ka bhai ko MCA entrance ke liye maths padhana hain.

03/12/21, 8:18 pm - Nafisa: 🤦‍♀️
03/12/21, 8:18 pm - Raktim Dey: Why, what does he say?
03/12/21, 8:18 pm - Nafisa: Random things
03/12/21, 8:18 pm - Nafisa: What he did, what he ate
03/12/21, 8:19 pm - Nafisa: Bla bla
03/12/21, 8:19 pm - Raktim Dey: Without you asking about all that? 😂
03/12/21, 8:20 pm - Nafisa: You think I will ask🤷‍♀️
03/12/21, 8:20 pm - Nafisa: Why on earth I will go to him for chit chat
03/12/21, 8:20 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
03/12/21, 8:20 pm - Raktim Dey: Ha, wahi. 😂
03/12/21, 8:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Maybe he's that bored. And he thinks you and Ben think of him as a friend.
03/12/21, 8:22 pm - Nafisa: Yeah
03/12/21, 8:22 pm - Nafisa: Maybe
03/12/21, 8:22 pm - Raktim Dey: Thankfully mujhe text nahi karta hain abhi.
03/12/21, 8:23 pm - Nafisa: I will suggest him someday when I am bored
03/12/21, 8:23 pm - Raktim Dey: I'm only in touch with you and Ben from Xavier's. And Dipanjan and Sourajyoti sometimes, when they text.
03/12/21, 8:23 pm - Nafisa: I will tell Raktim was asking about you, maybe ask him why
03/12/21, 8:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Great .
03/12/21, 8:23 pm - Raktim Dey: He will know that that's not true.
03/12/21, 8:24 pm - Nafisa: Ofcourse you will be in touch with me, if someday it decreases, paint your nails with my nail polish
03/12/21, 8:24 pm - Nafisa: Bet?
03/12/21, 8:24 pm - Nafisa: You can gpay me if i win
03/12/21, 8:24 pm - Raktim Dey: No. No bet.
03/12/21, 8:24 pm - Nafisa: 😔
03/12/21, 8:24 pm - Raktim Dey: But he isn't that chummy with me. 😂
03/12/21, 8:25 pm - Nafisa: I will make sure he is
03/12/21, 8:25 pm - Nafisa: Leave that to me
03/12/21, 8:25 pm - Raktim Dey: That's really not necessary. 😂
03/12/21, 8:25 pm - Nafisa: This.
03/12/21, 8:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes, I'll definitely do that.
03/12/21, 8:25 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
03/12/21, 8:25 pm - Nafisa: 😘😘
03/12/21, 8:26 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha, remember a few days ago I posted about that sexual assault on a kid thing?
03/12/21, 8:26 pm - Raktim Dey: That it was a lesser offense.
03/12/21, 8:29 pm - Nafisa: Yes
03/12/21, 8:33 pm - Raktim Dey: That wasn't the judge's fault. That was actually law. But anyway, I was very angry about the whole thing and that post was kind of a rant. Aritra commented on the post telling me that it was law and not the judge's fault. I was angry, so I didn't reply and kept it on seen. Then I see that he posts on Instagram about the same thing and writing that his post is accurate unlike others who are attention seeking or something like that.
03/12/21, 8:33 pm - Raktim Dey: Implying me.
03/12/21, 8:36 pm - Raktim Dey: I didn't say anything. I don't give a fuck what anyone thinks about me. Toh two days ago, when I posted my Spotify best artists, he replied and started asking me about my favorite jazz songs. I didn't really mind, so I sent him a few songs. But I had to do something. I knew that he listens to all that pop and rap music, that is, new music. So after sharing the songs, which were all old, I wrote "these are the best ones, because they are all from before 2000 obviously. "
03/12/21, 8:36 pm - Raktim Dey: He didn't reply, and again posted something about not listening to good songs that he got from someone else. 😂
03/12/21, 8:37 pm - Nafisa: Phew
03/12/21, 8:38 pm - Nafisa: 😂
03/12/21, 8:38 pm - Nafisa: You are my friend
03/12/21, 8:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Sometimes I know exactly what to say, to piss someone off. 😂
03/12/21, 8:38 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣🤣
03/12/21, 8:38 pm - Nafisa: And the pleasure we get is priceless
03/12/21, 8:38 pm - Raktim Dey: I have done this to Dipanjan so many times. 😂
03/12/21, 8:38 pm - Raktim Dey: Exactly. 😂
03/12/21, 8:39 pm - Nafisa: O God. I want to see this live🌚
03/12/21, 8:39 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂😂
03/12/21, 8:39 pm - Raktim Dey: It's very easy to get under his skin. Ronaldo ko leke kuch bhi minor comment karo, ya Virat Kohli, and done.
03/12/21, 8:39 pm - Nafisa: Why do aritra not tell u directly and post such stuffs? Didn't think he was that type
03/12/21, 8:40 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣Noobs
03/12/21, 8:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Exactly. That guy constantly kept texting me sometimes worrying about TIFR, dissertation. Kya padhna hain, etc.
03/12/21, 8:40 pm - Raktim Dey: And then he did all this.
03/12/21, 8:40 pm - Nafisa: Well ok, the judge thing,maybe misunderstanding but songs
03/12/21, 8:40 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't know.
03/12/21, 8:41 pm - Nafisa: About songs what he said in his postn
03/12/21, 8:41 pm - Nafisa: Post*
03/12/21, 8:41 pm - Raktim Dey: That he won't listen to good songs that he just got. Mere dekhne ke baad delete kar diya.
03/12/21, 8:42 pm - Raktim Dey: Anyway, I don't care. I hate rap and pop music both, so I had to say it.
03/12/21, 8:42 pm - Nafisa: Thats so stupid
03/12/21, 8:42 pm - Nafisa: I hate this
03/12/21, 8:42 pm - Nafisa: Not confronting directly
03/12/21, 8:42 pm - Nafisa: I would have sued his ass
03/12/21, 8:42 pm - Nafisa: After all a senior
03/12/21, 8:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Either confront directly, or don't say anything. Indirectly karna is just weird.
03/12/21, 8:43 pm - Raktim Dey: Like we respect our seniors. 😂
03/12/21, 8:43 pm - Nafisa: Yes, exactly
03/12/21, 8:43 pm - Nafisa: Even if we didn't we didn't show it
03/12/21, 8:43 pm - Raktim Dey: True.
03/12/21, 8:44 pm - Nafisa: Like I disliked Pritha di, but whenever I met her I talked nicely
03/12/21, 8:44 pm - Nafisa: I disliked Harsh so much, I just ignored
03/12/21, 8:44 pm - Nafisa: Except for one day not passing them the ball
03/12/21, 8:44 pm - Raktim Dey: I hated Akash, and when Ritika posted that kpop thing, I posted about him directly and kept it there for everyone to see.
03/12/21, 8:45 pm - Raktim Dey: That's not mean.
03/12/21, 8:45 pm - Nafisa: You ignore him next time he asks for help
03/12/21, 8:45 pm - Nafisa: Exactlyyyy
03/12/21, 8:45 pm - Raktim Dey: I don't know. I can't just ignore. 😂
03/12/21, 8:45 pm - Nafisa: Same
03/12/21, 8:45 pm - Nafisa: So I pray to God I never face them
03/12/21, 8:45 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. 😂
03/12/21, 8:45 pm - Nafisa: I did this
03/12/21, 8:46 pm - Raktim Dey: That's not a big deal. That's fine.
03/12/21, 8:46 pm - Nafisa: No
03/12/21, 8:46 pm - Nafisa: They asked me to pass the ball
03/12/21, 8:46 pm - Raktim Dey: Oh. 😂
03/12/21, 8:46 pm - Nafisa: I looked at them, I saw Harsh
03/12/21, 8:46 pm - Nafisa: I looked at the ball, and walked passed
03/12/21, 8:47 pm - Raktim Dey: He deserved it.
03/12/21, 8:47 pm - Nafisa: I wish I could slap him
03/12/21, 8:47 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
03/12/21, 8:47 pm - Raktim Dey: That might have been a bit much, college ke andar. 😂
03/12/21, 8:47 pm - Nafisa: Violence is not allowed obviously
03/12/21, 8:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
03/12/21, 8:47 pm - Nafisa: Ofcourse, that unethical
03/12/21, 8:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
03/12/21, 8:48 pm - Nafisa: Thats why we have imaginations
03/12/21, 8:48 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
03/12/21, 8:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
03/12/21, 8:48 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂
03/12/21, 8:49 pm - Nafisa: On deeper level I relate with you alot of times
03/12/21, 8:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. That's why we're still friends.
03/12/21, 8:49 pm - Nafisa: You don't have any other choice
03/12/21, 8:49 pm - Nafisa: Once u choose me there is no going back
03/12/21, 8:49 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
03/12/21, 8:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay okay. 😂

03/12/21, 8:50 pm - Raktim Dey: Kya pata. I can't really tell in his case.
03/12/21, 8:50 pm - Nafisa: Seeing his posts and stories I doubt my feelings are feelings or not😂😂
03/12/21, 8:50 pm - Raktim Dey: He's very unpredictable.
03/12/21, 8:51 pm - Nafisa: I understand
03/12/21, 8:51 pm - Raktim Dey: Romantic posts?
03/12/21, 8:51 pm - Nafisa: You didn't see?
03/12/21, 8:51 pm - Nafisa: His story?

03/12/21, 8:51 pm - Nafisa: Typical Raktim
03/12/21, 8:51 pm - Raktim Dey: I pay very little attention to whatsApp posts and insta stories.

03/12/21, 10:27 pm - Raktim Dey: I can't speak for him, but I feel it's been quite a while since his father passed away. I'm sure he's reminded of his father's absence by other things, but this picture is a happy picture of his family. I'm sure he'll like it.
03/12/21, 10:27 pm - Raktim Dey: It's very thoughtful.

03/12/21, 10:30 pm - Raktim Dey: But if you're unsure, send him one of the pictures of the day all of you met that day, with Sejuti and Ritika. And you'll be in it too. He'll love that as well.
03/12/21, 10:31 pm - Nafisa: We didn't get a group picture that day😭

07/12/21, 12:45 am - Raktim Dey: But compound interest galat hain.

08/12/21, 10:37 pm - Nafisa: Yes yes
08/12/21, 11:00 pm - Raktim Dey: You're supposed to divide by 2.5374 to get inches. And same for feet. Divide karna hoga.
08/12/21, 11:00 pm - Raktim Dey: 1 inch =2.54 cm.
08/12/21, 11:00 pm - Raktim Dey: And you're not supposed to write "kindly enter". That's too polite.
08/12/21, 11:00 pm - Nafisa: No
08/12/21, 11:01 pm - Raktim Dey: What?
08/12/21, 11:01 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>

08/12/21, 11:02 pm - Nafisa: Both?
08/12/21, 11:02 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
08/12/21, 11:03 pm - Nafisa: Wait
08/12/21, 11:03 pm - Nafisa: 1 inch = 1/0.39 cm toh
08/12/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: Then y inch = x/0.39 cm
08/12/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: Sahi toh hain
08/12/21, 11:04 pm - Nafisa: This is 2.53 so 1inch =2.53 cm
08/12/21, 11:05 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
08/12/21, 11:05 pm - Nafisa: So I am correct right?
08/12/21, 11:05 pm - Raktim Dey: 2.54 scales me likha rehta hain. So use that.
08/12/21, 11:06 pm - Nafisa: Ok
08/12/21, 11:06 pm - Raktim Dey: But wo dono divide hi hoga.

08/12/21, 11:09 pm - Nafisa: So dumb
08/12/21, 11:09 pm - Raktim Dey: It's fine.
08/12/21, 11:09 pm - Nafisa: Achha

09/12/21, 12:21 pm - Nafisa: No
09/12/21, 12:21 pm - Nafisa: Not fair
09/12/21, 12:21 pm - Nafisa: I won, she didn't post anything by herself as per our bet
09/12/21, 12:51 pm - Raktim Dey: We didn't say anything about posting by herself. We talked about posting, which she did.
09/12/21, 12:55 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
09/12/21, 12:55 pm - Nafisa: Ok
11/12/21, 10:10 pm - Raktim Dey: I was supposed to meet Mayurakshi today in that cafe in Maidan. I was halfway there when she said she can't come.
11/12/21, 10:10 pm - Raktim Dey: This time I was angry. 😂
11/12/21, 10:12 pm - Raktim Dey: See, that's how good a friend you are to me. 😂
11/12/21, 10:12 pm - Nafisa: 😭😭
11/12/21, 10:12 pm - Nafisa: Aweeee
11/12/21, 10:13 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂😂
11/12/21, 10:13 pm - Nafisa: I know
11/12/21, 10:13 pm - Nafisa: Thats why I made sure I come to you the next day
11/12/21, 10:13 pm - Nafisa: But what was her reason?
11/12/21, 10:13 pm - Raktim Dey: Tuition.
11/12/21, 10:14 pm - Raktim Dey: I felt like I was gonna lose my veil of politeness and show my anger, but obviously I didn't.
11/12/21, 10:14 pm - Nafisa: She didn't know
11/12/21, 10:15 pm - Nafisa: Good, becoz she is not that type to cancel plans like that
11/12/21, 10:15 pm - Nafisa: Phele se?
11/12/21, 10:15 pm - Raktim Dey: It was her fault. But anyway, it's difficult to explain right now.
11/12/21, 10:15 pm - Nafisa: Bolona
11/12/21, 10:17 pm - Raktim Dey: Are, I didn't know it was tuition. I assumed it was college ka online class. I told her to meet me at 4. She said she had class till 4-4:30, so we should meet at 5. I said 5:30 pe milte hain. Nikalne se 30 minute pehle, I texted her asking if she's coming or not. I texted three times, she didn't reply. So I assumed she's coming and I left at 4. When I'm in bus, she says she's stuck in tuition and it started late and she can't come.
11/12/21, 10:18 pm - Raktim Dey: She kept asking me why I left so early at 4. I felt like I saying because I have to travel in bus and metro, because I don't have a car or 1000 rupees to travel by Uber everytime I go out of my home.
11/12/21, 10:18 pm - Raktim Dey: It's an embarrassing thing to say.
11/12/21, 10:19 pm - Nafisa: No
11/12/21, 10:21 pm - Nafisa: Its never embarrassing, if it was I wouldn't have told u I was broke so can u tell me a cheaper way to travel, don't be embarrass of your situation,be proud that you are carrying on despite everything, I sometimes wear it as a pride
11/12/21, 10:21 pm - Raktim Dey: Again, not the same thing. I can say it to you, not her.
11/12/21, 10:21 pm - Nafisa: You should have told her I left early becoz I had to travel with bus
11/12/21, 10:22 pm - Raktim Dey: It's a personal thing. I can't say it to her.
11/12/21, 10:22 pm - Nafisa: I understand, but try to be  open about this to everyone, well isn't easy, have been through but I am learning and you can do it
11/12/21, 10:22 pm - Nafisa: Okok
11/12/21, 10:22 pm - Nafisa: Leavr it
11/12/21, 10:23 pm - Nafisa: This message was deleted
11/12/21, 10:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah. Anyway. She said sorry a few times. I didn't reply for a few hours.
11/12/21, 10:23 pm - Raktim Dey: Thori der pehle reply diya.
11/12/21, 10:23 pm - Nafisa: Ok ok
11/12/21, 10:23 pm - Nafisa: Wasn't her fault completely
11/12/21, 10:23 pm - Nafisa: Its was a misunderstanding
11/12/21, 10:24 pm - Raktim Dey: Not really. If she replied when I texted her 30 minutes ago, main nahi nikalta.
11/12/21, 10:24 pm - Nafisa: And next time when someone don't reply, call them, so that they know its an emergency
11/12/21, 10:24 pm - Raktim Dey: She doesn't answer.
11/12/21, 10:24 pm - Nafisa: Maybe she was stuck with tuition and phone nahi dekha
11/12/21, 10:25 pm - Nafisa: Choro
11/12/21, 10:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
11/12/21, 10:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Pata hain aj kya hua.
11/12/21, 10:25 pm - Nafisa: Maybe don't talk to her for now, calm down
11/12/21, 10:25 pm - Nafisa: Bolo
11/12/21, 10:25 pm - Raktim Dey: Don't tell Biswajit I told you. 😂

20/12/21, 12:06 am - Raktim Dey: According to Chekhov, we can't ever be happy the way we want. When we are happy, we don't stop there. We want something more.

20/12/21, 12:15 am - Nafisa: Like?
20/12/21, 12:16 am - Raktim Dey: I feel that I'd like to be alone too in the end, not be with anyone, unless by some twisted, absolutely unbelievable and unrealistic way, I meet Minerva again. That's how I feel.
20/12/21, 12:16 am - Raktim Dey: And don't say anything about this please.
20/12/21, 12:17 am - Raktim Dey: Let's just move on.

21/12/21, 12:27 am - Raktim Dey: She never said anything like that about him though.

21/12/21, 12:28 am - Nafisa: Not like that but here i know
21/12/21, 12:28 am - Nafisa: She is a type who rarely likes guys in that way
21/12/21, 12:28 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know.
21/12/21, 12:28 am - Nafisa: Least interested
21/12/21, 12:29 am - Raktim Dey: I never posted pictures because firstly I don't post pictures with people, and secondly I didn't know how Dipanjan would react.
21/12/21, 12:29 am - Raktim Dey: It would get awkward.
21/12/21, 12:30 am - Nafisa: Why do he bother you? Not him but his presence
21/12/21, 12:30 am - Raktim Dey: Not like that.
21/12/21, 12:30 am - Nafisa: Like u think of him so much
21/12/21, 12:30 am - Nafisa: U do
21/12/21, 12:31 am - Raktim Dey: He told me once how much he liked her. So I always feel a bit awkward about Mayurakshi.
21/12/21, 12:32 am - Raktim Dey: Arre, he texts me sometimes. Aj bhi convocation ke message ke baad kiya tha.
21/12/21, 12:34 am - Nafisa: Thats ok
21/12/21, 12:34 am - Nafisa: So, you feel, you will be betraying him, if he sees u with her?
21/12/21, 12:34 am - Nafisa: You have a fear about him or some kind of attachment
21/12/21, 12:35 am - Nafisa: Fear of hurting him?
21/12/21, 12:36 am - Nafisa: Oye??
21/12/21, 12:37 am - Raktim Dey: Ek minute. Load shedding hua hain
21/12/21, 12:37 am - Raktim Dey: .
21/12/21, 12:37 am - Nafisa: Okok
21/12/21, 12:38 am - Raktim Dey: I don't know, it might feel like a betrayal. It happened once before kind of. Anirban did ask Minerva out first, and uske baad hi I told her. So that was something wrong that I did to him.
21/12/21, 12:39 am - Raktim Dey: This is not the same, because it was different with Minerva, but still.
21/12/21, 12:39 am - Nafisa: O hello!
21/12/21, 12:39 am - Nafisa: Listen
21/12/21, 12:39 am - Nafisa: You don't take that responsibility
21/12/21, 12:39 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I know.
21/12/21, 12:39 am - Nafisa: It was Mg's mistake
21/12/21, 12:40 am - Nafisa: You realised about your feelings when u saw she was going to be someone else
21/12/21, 12:40 am - Raktim Dey: Anyway, it doesn't matter. I'm not gonna approach Mayurakshi that way.
21/12/21, 12:40 am - Nafisa: Else's*
21/12/21, 12:41 am - Nafisa: You can approach mayurakshi and if u are worried about dipanjan u tell him u like her or maybe don't
21/12/21, 12:41 am - Raktim Dey: No no, it's not because of that.
21/12/21, 12:41 am - Raktim Dey: I wasn't serious about her and she wasn't either.
21/12/21, 12:41 am - Nafisa: Ben knew Archie liked Paul, after few months when archie asked her out, Ben did, Paul said no to Archie ans yes to Ben
21/12/21, 12:42 am - Nafisa: and*
21/12/21, 12:42 am - Nafisa: How is it Ben's fault Paul didn't like Archie and him
21/12/21, 12:42 am - Nafisa: Not his right
21/12/21, 12:42 am - Nafisa: So likely not yours
21/12/21, 12:42 am - Nafisa: Mayurakshi?
21/12/21, 12:43 am - Raktim Dey: That day, I just wanted to go through that cafe, so I asked her. The cafe was the main point. After we couldn't go, Biswajit said he'll go. And then he included his girlfriend as well. I said okay, no problem. Then kuch din baad bolta hain utna dur coffee peene nahi jaana. Kahi aur chale khaane. I said no.
21/12/21, 12:43 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
21/12/21, 12:43 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah. I guess it's not.
21/12/21, 12:44 am - Nafisa: I will take you
21/12/21, 12:44 am - Raktim Dey: Okay. 😂
21/12/21, 12:44 am - Nafisa: I wish I could
21/12/21, 12:44 am - Raktim Dey: I have to go to Xavier's on Wednesday. Maybe tab chala jaunga.
21/12/21, 12:44 am - Nafisa: Haan

27/12/21, 12:48 pm - Raktim Dey: That's their solution.
27/12/21, 12:48 pm - Nafisa: JNU too
27/12/21, 12:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Drawing tangible line. The fuck that means.
27/12/21, 12:49 pm - Nafisa: They know
27/12/21, 12:49 pm - Nafisa: How do they come up with such thoughts
27/12/21, 12:49 pm - Raktim Dey: It's all ingrained in the heads of our previous generations.
27/12/21, 12:49 pm - Raktim Dey: Now they are trying to pass it on to the next ones.
27/12/21, 12:50 pm - Nafisa: I pray it doesn't

27/12/21, 11:34 pm - Nafisa: Such a show off
27/12/21, 11:34 pm - Raktim Dey: It gets really annoying, yeah.
27/12/21, 11:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Wait.
27/12/21, 11:34 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
27/12/21, 11:35 pm - Nafisa: 🙂

27/12/21, 11:37 pm - Nafisa: I may end up bursting the balloons though
27/12/21, 11:37 pm - Raktim Dey: Maybe. But still, so pretty. 😂
27/12/21, 11:37 pm - Raktim Dey: Better than Tanu and her friends.
27/12/21, 11:38 pm - Nafisa: Exactly
27/12/21, 11:38 pm - Nafisa: These are things to ve shared
27/12/21, 11:38 pm - Nafisa: Not what Tanu does
27/12/21, 11:39 pm - Nafisa: The whole menu
27/12/21, 11:39 pm - Raktim Dey: She has to show how good a time she's having. For her, showing it to others is more fun than actually being there.
27/12/21, 11:39 pm - Nafisa: Exactly😂😂😂
27/12/21, 11:40 pm - Nafisa: Man ki baat chin li tune
27/12/21, 11:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
27/12/21, 11:40 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂
27/12/21, 11:48 pm - Raktim Dey: It's weird that she posts the same pictures both in WhatsApp and Instagram. Like she's trying to get the word out how great her life is.

28/12/21, 12:51 pm - Nafisa: Exam kemon gelon
28/12/21, 12:51 pm - Nafisa: gelo*?
28/12/21, 12:52 pm - Raktim Dey: It was messy. First part quiz tha, and I got almost all the answers wrong. Phir re attempt ka option tha. I did it again. Ek 10 mark ka question tha jo maine pehle galat kiya tha. Uska answer wahi pe show kar diya first time me. Phir second time me maine wo correct kar diya. 😂
28/12/21, 12:52 pm - Raktim Dey: Phir CMI ke server me problem tha, question ka adha part ek ghanta late karke aya.
28/12/21, 12:53 pm - Nafisa: Issshhh!!
28/12/21, 12:53 pm - Raktim Dey: 4 months me 3 saal ka statistics course karaaya tha.

28/12/21, 1:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Biswajit's face is full of disappointment and I was just realising the humour in the situation.

28/12/21, 1:31 pm - Nafisa: You look so cute
28/12/21, 1:31 pm - Raktim Dey: 😂😂

28/12/21, 1:32 pm - Nafisa: So funny
28/12/21, 1:32 pm - Nafisa: Then u stayed there only?
28/12/21, 1:32 pm - Raktim Dey: We didn't stay there. Hotel me chale gaye the hum 3. Only Saahil stayed there.
28/12/21, 1:33 pm - Nafisa: O
28/12/21, 1:33 pm - Nafisa: Who was the fourth one?
28/12/21, 1:33 pm - Raktim Dey: And the thing is, they were filthy rich. 3 floor wala ghar bana rahe the. Hum log ko us room me rehne diye.
28/12/21, 1:33 pm - Raktim Dey: Biswajit's classmate from Techno India.
28/12/21, 1:33 pm - Nafisa: Ouch! Bad
28/12/21, 1:33 pm - Nafisa: Achha
28/12/21, 1:34 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.

29/12/21, 5:52 pm - Nafisa: Ayyyy❤️❤️

29/12/21, 10:26 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I might.
29/12/21, 10:26 pm - Raktim Dey: I know I'll hate it but still. Aur kuch karne ko nahi hain. 😂
29/12/21, 10:29 pm - Nafisa: 🤦‍♀️
29/12/21, 10:29 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂
29/12/21, 10:29 pm - Nafisa: Yeah
29/12/21, 10:29 pm - Nafisa: You can observe who matched thier online personality
29/12/21, 10:29 pm - Nafisa: Observing people is a fun activity
29/12/21, 10:30 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, I can do that. I kept telling ki koi restaurant me jaane ke liye. If they decide to go to Nicco Park, I'm out.
29/12/21, 10:30 pm - Raktim Dey: It's a group of 25 people. Definitely not gonna be fun.
29/12/21, 10:30 pm - Nafisa: 😂😂😂
29/12/21, 10:31 pm - Nafisa: 25 nahi ayenge
29/12/21, 10:31 pm - Nafisa: So many will cancel at last moment
29/12/21, 10:31 pm - Nafisa: So many people at amusement park is fun toh
29/12/21, 10:31 pm - Raktim Dey: You know, I told them in the group ki agar wo log Nicco Park me jayenge, maybe someone will get Covid and CMI nahi ja payenge and my chance of going to hostel will increase.
29/12/21, 10:32 pm - Raktim Dey: Eco Park is better. Nicco Park is expensive and too many children go there. It gets annoying.
29/12/21, 10:35 pm - Nafisa: 🤣🤣
29/12/21, 10:35 pm - Nafisa: Too good
29/12/21, 10:35 pm - Nafisa: Yeah but its fun too, the water park
29/12/21, 10:36 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, but it's awkward to go with a bunch of strangers you're meeting for the first time.
29/12/21, 10:37 pm - Nafisa: Right
29/12/21, 10:37 pm - Nafisa: Eco park is much better
29/12/21, 10:37 pm - Raktim Dey: I know.
30/12/21, 7:52 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
30/12/21, 7:52 pm - Raktim Dey: The best coffee I have ever had in my entire life.

30/12/21, 7:53 pm - Raktim Dey: It's very, very good.
30/12/21, 7:53 pm - Nafisa: Its sweet?
30/12/21, 7:53 pm - Nafisa: Caramel
30/12/21, 7:53 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.

01/01/22, 12:34 am - Nafisa: ❤️✨
01/01/22, 12:35 am - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
01/01/22, 7:34 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
01/01/22, 7:35 pm - Nafisa: Integration ke saat partial differentiation kese karu?
01/01/22, 7:35 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
01/01/22, 7:37 pm - Raktim Dey: <Media omitted>
01/01/22, 7:39 pm - Nafisa: <Media omitted>
01/01/22, 7:40 pm - Raktim Dey: Ha, theoretically possible hoga. Tum pehle integration karke phir differentiate kar sakte ho, to make sure it's correct.
01/01/22, 7:43 pm - Raktim Dey: It's kind of like Leibniz's rule, but differentiating wrt constants.
01/01/22, 7:44 pm - Nafisa: Parameters matlab kya hota hain?
01/01/22, 7:44 pm - Raktim Dey: The variables.
01/01/22, 7:44 pm - Raktim Dey: x, yaha pe.
01/01/22, 7:45 pm - Nafisa: No
01/01/22, 7:45 pm - Nafisa: Cs are parameters
01/01/22, 7:46 pm - Raktim Dey: Those are constants.
01/01/22, 7:46 pm - Nafisa: x also
01/01/22, 7:46 pm - Nafisa: Yes
01/01/22, 7:46 pm - Nafisa: Nahi re
01/01/22, 7:46 pm - Nafisa: They are parameters
01/01/22, 7:46 pm - Raktim Dey: Okay.
01/01/22, 7:46 pm - Nafisa: We differentiate with respect to them to find their values
01/01/22, 7:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah, in this case.
01/01/22, 7:47 pm - Nafisa: Yeah
01/01/22, 7:47 pm - Raktim Dey: So is your doubt cleared?
01/01/22, 7:47 pm - Nafisa: Haan
01/01/22, 7:47 pm - Nafisa: So its correct only but complicated
01/01/22, 7:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Ye integration hain ya partial differential?
01/01/22, 7:47 pm - Raktim Dey: Yes.
01/01/22, 7:47 pm - Raktim Dey: The topic I mean.
01/01/22, 7:47 pm - Nafisa: We can differentiate with respect to constants too?
01/01/22, 7:48 pm - Nafisa: Numerical Analysis
01/01/22, 7:48 pm - Raktim Dey: I didn't know that before.
01/01/22, 7:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Achha.
01/01/22, 7:48 pm - Nafisa: Partial differentiation
01/01/22, 7:48 pm - Raktim Dey: Constants ke respect me differentiate karne se hamesha hi toh 0 milega.
01/01/22, 7:49 pm - Raktim Dey: So they're not treating them as constants.
01/01/22, 7:50 pm - Nafisa: Haan wahi
01/01/22, 7:50 pm - Nafisa: They are parametees
01/01/22, 7:50 pm - Raktim Dey: Yeah.
01/01/22, 7:50 pm - Nafisa: Ayy hayy
01/01/22, 7:50 pm - Nafisa: I hate today
01/01/22, 7:50 pm - Nafisa: I did same sum
01/01/22, 7:50 pm - Nafisa: Wrong
